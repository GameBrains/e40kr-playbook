Where you use this symbol to mean either (as in and/or), do not surround it with spaces. Use the % symbol, not the word percent. If you are compelled to spell it out for some reason then note that both percent and per cent are acceptable — but let’s favour percent, to be consistent. Use numerals, except in these cases in prose where you should use words: Where you use a common expression (one or two of them; three’s company). Where you start a sentence with a number (Twenty Land Raiders? That’s a lot of firepower!). Where you state a simple fraction (one half; two thirds). Ordinals one through nine (first; ninth); thereafter, use the numeral with 'st', 'nd', 'rd' or 'th' as appropriate, in superscript (8th army; 41st millennium; 33rd regiment). In general prose, you can use contractions 'k' (thousands), 'm' (millions) and 'bn' (billions) for items and money — but only with numerals, and never for people or distances. * When you use a contraction, place it next to the numeral (no space). For units, use the appropriate abbreviations or symbols in most cases (10 cm, not 10 centimetres). And in general, use a space to separate these from the numeral just as you would for the full term. Some exceptions where you should not use a space include: ° (degrees); °C (degrees Centigrade) \" (inches) % (percent) Note that the plural of an abbreviated unit is the same as the singular (25 cm, not 25 cms). Example 1. Contractions and units two billion of the Emperor’s subjects, not two bn 4,200 km, not 4.2k km 22.5 MB, not 22.5MB 7bn credits, not 7 bn credits For decimal values of less than 1, always include the leading '0' (0.3, not .3). For numerals over 999, insert commas for clarity (1,000; 2,500,000). Use to in number ranges, or use en dash if you must –, not hyphen - or em dash — (8 to 12 vehicles; 8–12 vehicles). Example 2. More examples for numbers We fired 7,043 rounds of ammunition There are three million barrels of fuel at stake — or, There are 3m barrels of fuel at stake There are 7 million people in that one hive city A quarter of a million Guardsmen At a cost of 10bn credits The first wave of the attack The 11th planet in the system Two-thirds of the enemy’s total strength On average, five D6 rolls that require a 4+ result will yield 2.5 hits Before an acronym, let pronunciation be your guide: an SHT (ess-aytch-tee), not a SHT; a CCW (see-see-double-yoo), not an CCW. Before a silent h use 'an' (it’s an honest mistake) but where the h is pronounced use 'a' (we found a heretic). Use abbreviations with care. Don’t take it for granted that all readers are familiar with an abbreviation. Do give the full expansion the first time you use the term in a topic. If you will use the abbreviation of the term later in the topic, then first put it in brackets immediately after the full expansion. A super-heavy tank (SHT) is a fearsome machine. It’s common for several SHTs to work together…​ Don’t use an unfamiliar abbreviation if it won’t be used again in the text. Don’t use an abbreviation as a verb (Use SHWs against prime targets, not SHW prime targets). Don’t include full stops in abbreviations. Don’t use an apostrophe to pluralise abbreviations unless the abbreviation ends in an s (the titan destroyed two SHTs; Epic 40,000 was published in the late 1990s). See also abbreviations. We define an acronym as a set of initial letters of words, which we then pronounce as a word (PIN; NASA). We define an initialism as a set of initial letters of words, which we do not pronounce as a word (SHT; GW). In general, you should use upper case for both acronyms and initialisms. But note the common exceptions: Where an acronym is used as a proper name then you may capitalise just the first letter, to avoid an excess of capital letters (Nasa). But in general, aim to follow whatever convention the organisation itself uses. Some words that started out as acronyms are now treated as orthodox nouns (as with laser). Take extra care with a and an before an acronym or initialism (see a; an). Asciidoc includes five built-in admonition types: NOTE; TIP; IMPORTANT; CAUTION; WARNING. We define our usage in this project at How to use this publication. Learn about the markup at Admonitions (external URL). We also use custom admonitions, based on the built-in types. You can only use these with the block markup — you can’t use them with the inline markup. For 'Epic 40,000 difference' notes, use footnotes in the form footnote:[{e40k-diff}]. When you mean to refer to an early product release in prose, use upper case. This is an ALPHA release. Don’t use This is in ALPHA. Do not place spaces around the forward slash. Use your judgement here. Words like allows, needs, offers and permits are anthropomorphic, but generally acceptable. See Anthropomorphism (external URL). Also, choose your words such that you don’t conflate things that the player does or that happen as game effects with things that happen 'in universe'. Use the normal possessive ending ('s) after singular words or names that end in s (Warboss’s retinue; Saint Scythus’s fame), and after plurals that do not end in s (Gretchin’s; Eldar’s; Guardsmen’s). Use the ending s' on plurals that end in s (the Orks' warlike nature; the Warbosses' armies converged. Do not insert apostrophes into decades or centuries (the 1990s; the 2000s). Asciidoc includes 'sidebar' markup that is suitable to hold content that is an 'aside' from the main content. We define our usage in this project at How to use this publication. Sometimes an aside is a better fit than an admonition. Either way, don’t overdo it. Learn about the markup at Sidebars (external URL). Asciidoc includes markup that you can use to apply a title to a block element. We haven’t fully defined our usage yet, but in general: Use a block title to provide clarity or sub-structure where the content doesn’t warrant a full heading (and built-in anchor). Learn about the markup at Add a Title to a Block (external URL). Aside from Asciidoc markup, use brackets in the content as follows: Default to round brackets ( ) for most use cases. Where you use them for parenthesis, try to do this only at the end of a sentence, or — where appropriate — consider em dashes instead, as in this sentence. Use square brackets [ ] where you need to insert a comment or clarification as an editor. You will also need to type an empty attribute in front, such as {blank}, to 'escape' them from the normal Asciidoc processing (you could use + at each end, but this will escape everything inside, so then URLs and such won’t work either). Avoid curly brackets { }, except where you have a special use case — and then you’ll need to escape them in the same way as for square brackets. If you introduce the list with a lead-in sentence, end that sentence with a colon. If the bullets are a continuation of a lead-in sentence like this, then: ensure that each bullet is a single sentence, with no full stops ensure that every sentence makes sense as a continuation of the lead-in sentence do not capitalise the first word of each bullet (unless it is a proper noun or acronym of course, as usual) do not add a full stop or other punctuation at the end of any sentence — not even to the last one if you really need to create a sentence with more than one (related) clause then use a semi-colon or an em dash — but don’t overdo it If the bullets are not a continuation of a lead-in sentence, write the sentences or paragraphs as normal. See also steps (ordered lists). Cannon as a plural is a bit archaic and can appear odd, as in this statement: Distortion cannon bore an unstable warp hole in the fabric of reality. — Epic 40,000 Rule Book So, use cannon for the singular and cannons for plural. Do capitalise Proper nouns (people, places, names, brands): Ancient Terra; the Imperium of Man. Titles of publications. See also citations. Names of computer languages, protocols and reference standards: File Transfer Protocol. Special keywords in this project, when you use them in their special sense: Keywords for special abilities and super-heavy weapons, such as Death Ray. Though in most cases, in the Asciidoc source, you should use a defined attribute which outputs with the correct capitalisation and formatting anyway (in this case, you’d type {death-ray} to invoke the correct attribute). Unit characteristics, such as Firepower value and Damage Capacity value. Unit types, such as War Engine unit. The correct way to pluralise a keyword like War Engine is to add the correct plural noun: War Engine units, not War Engines. Do not capitalise Compass directions and derivations (north, east, south and west; southern Necromunda; the north-western wastelands) — unless they form part of an actual or implied proper name for a region. Expansions of initialisms, except where the expansion includes words that we would normally capitalise anyway: super-heavy tank (SHT), not Super-Heavy Tank (SHT). Terms that also happen to be special keywords, when we don’t use them as such: The Space Marines put up a stubborn resistance, not The Space Marines put up a Stubborn resistance. Terms that can have a particular meaning in the rules, but which do not act as special keywords: detachment; unit type; unit. Take extra care with terms that can have a particular meaning, to avoid ambiguity in the rules — don’t mix terms like 'detachment' and 'unit', and don’t use synonyms like 'formation'. Do not use UPPER CASE for emphasis. In the absence of other guidance for a particular case, give citations in the following format: , , . For example: Path of the Eldar, White Dwarf, issue 214. Use the same words and capitalisation as in the target publication. Some contractions are okay, as we don’t want to sound too formal — such as they’ve, we’ll, can’t and don’t. Avoid others like should’ve, could’ve and would’ve, and don’t use incorrect perversions of these contractions such as should of or coulda. Similarly, avoid they’re — or at least use the correct homophone for the context (they’re/their/there). There’s no one 'right way', but here are some good conventions: For a long date format, use {day name in full} {day number, with ordinals} {month in full} {year, four digits} with no commas and no 'of' (Monday 3rd of September 2020). For a short date format, use {day number, two digits}-{month number, two digits}-{year number, four digits} (22-09-2019). Or, use the reverse order format when the 'sort order' is important or when there may be confusion with the US 'month first' date format (2019-09-22). For 12-hour format, always use a colon and am or pm — no full stops, and no spaces (6:30am). For 24-hour format, omit the colon, always use the leading zero for the single-digit hours, and append 'h' (0630h). These rules help to avoid the doubt that can arise from 12:30 or 1230. Use midnight and midday — not 12pm, noon, 12 noon. For a range of time, use the word to — or failing that, use an en dash as stated at Numbers. In prose, avoid abbreviation of dates. If abbreviations are necessary because of space limitations, then use the common three/four letter abbreviations (Mon; Thur; Jan; Sept). Example 3. Dates and times Long form: Monday 4th of September 2020 from 10:30am to 12:30pm. Shorter form: Mon 04 Sept 2020, 10:30am–12:30pm. Shortest form: 2020-09-04 1030h–1230h. Dice = plural of die. Die = singular of dice. Use the correct form — just because some manufacturers can’t seem to get it right doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t! These are contractions of 'electronic '. Do not hyphenate everyday examples like email and ebook — and do not insert needless capital letters (eBook). Capitalise as normal if you mean the proper noun, and not if you don’t (None now remember Earth as it was; just a mess of earth and craters. A contraction of a Latin term that we use to mean for example or such as. Lower case. No stops. However, avoid this term and use plain English instead. If you really must use it for some reason, then use it at the start of a new sentence or parenthesis, with a comma. Eg, like this or (eg, like this). Do not confuse with ie, which has a different meaning. Use bold styling for emphasis, not UPPER CASE or italics. If you must use this abbreviation of the Latin term then do not end it with a full stop (unless it is at the end of a sentence of course!) — but see etcetera. A Latin term that we use to mean and so on. However, avoid this term and use plain English instead. Better yet, consider whether you can make a more concise and complete statement rather than leave the reader with questions about what the 'other stuff' you allude to might be. Farther refers to length or distance — it is the comparative form of the word 'far'. Use this word in relation to physical distance. Further can mean 'to a greater degree', 'additional', or 'also', in reference to time, amount or continuation. Use this word for metaphorical or figurative distance or degree. Avoid continuations with this word — use 'also' or consider whether you can make a simpler sentence. Where the focus in on a particular file extension, use the monospace/code text format, precede with a full stop, and type the extension in lower case unless this is not usual (Check the names of all .pdf files in the list). Where the focus is on the actual file format itself, or on the type of file in general, type the abbreviation in its standard form — usually upper case (use the JPEG format for photos; PDF files are good for archival). If the extension/format/type is unusual and likely to be unfamiliar to the reader, introduce it at the first mention in much the same way as for initialisms — or even with a short explanation if it is important. See Topic titles and topic file names (external URL). Writers often use 'fire' as a synonym for 'shoot'. Needless variation can lead to ambiguity, so be consistent and use 'shoot' throughout the rules. Outside of the rules context, it is okay to use 'fire' where it is a more 'natural' match for your prose. Use only standard capitalisation, also known as sentence case. Never use title case or full upper case for headings. Get some tips on how to construct good headings at Titles and headings (external URL). It can be tricky to use hyperlinks well in documentation. Get some tips at Write effective hyperlinks (external URL). Hyphenate two-part words where it makes sense to separate repeated vowels (co-operate; pre-eminent; pre-empt; re-entry). Do not use a hyphen where you should use a semi-colon, colon, em dash or en dash — each has its own purpose, so learn to use them as outlined in this guide. See also e-words. Be careful with words that end with ing, especially gerunds (that is, verb forms which function as nouns, such as 'shooting'). It is all too easy to use such words in ways that weaken the text and create more room for doubt. Use more descriptive verbs or more plain and powerful phrases instead. For more information, see Are -ing words really that bad? (external URL). Example 4. -ing words You measured, and then shot with the Vehicle unit, not You were measuring and shooting the Vehicle unit. Use a phrase like Shoot with a super-heavy weapon, not Shooting a super-heavy weapon (and not Shoot a super-heavy weapon either). Use a phrase like We plan to improve the shooting rules, not We are planning on improving the shooting rules. A contraction of a Latin term that we use to mean that is. No full stops. Lower case. Use it with a comma either side, ie, like this — or comma after in parenthesis (ie, like this). Do not confuse with eg, which has a different meaning. However, avoid this term and use plain English instead. The worldwide collection of networks that offer a number of services, one of which is the Web. In general, use lower case (internet access; internet service provider). It isn’t wrong to capitalise when you use the word as a proper noun — the Internet — but it can be tricky. Be consistent, and if you want to know more see When Should I Capitalise 'Internet'? (external URL). It’s is a contraction of it is. Its means belonging to, much like his and hers — no apostrophe. Its' is meaningless. Do not use italics for emphasis. Use italics to reference the title of an article, document or publication, or for defined keywords where appropriate. [TODO: Rationalise use of italics in this A to Z.] In general, avoid Latin terms and their contractions like etcetera, ad hoc, ie and eg. They may be obscure to some readers. Use plain English alternatives instead. Use UK English word choices and phrases — but avoid terms that can confuse readers who are more familiar with other varieties of English, or for whom English may not be their first language. That said, there is a difference between informative content such as rules, and entertainment content such as short stories. This style guide is mostly concerned with standards for informative content, to make the rules as clear as possible. For entertainment content, it is okay to add interest through a more varied use of UK English, just as Games Workshop does. There are no plans to translate this project into other languages or to adapt it to other locales. See also spelling. Log in = verb. Login = noun. (To log in, enter your username and password in the login form; If you’ve forgotten your login details, contact support) none = pronoun that means not one or not any (they checked the floor for dice, but there were none). non- = a prefix that we add to a term to mean not or the opposite of that term (non-human; non-functional). See Numbers. Upper case. Okay is also acceptable. Lower case. open source = noun (this software is open source). open-source = adjective (open-source software). Don’t use open-sourced as an adjective. One word, no hyphen. One word, no hyphen. See Numbers. operating system. Don’t use O-S or O/S or O.S. Note that Apple devices use iOS or MacOS, and Google Android-based devices use Android OS. Do not use passive case, except where there really is no better way — which there usually is unless you have a specific need to be vague about agency. Instead, use the active case, usually in the imperative, and in the first or second person. It should always be clear who or what is the 'actor' in the sentence. For rules, assume that the reader is the primary actor even though they might actually read the rules to check what their opponent may or may not do. Example 5. Active case, not passive case First person: We will release, not It will be released. Second person, imperative: Check that there are no dice on the floor, not It is recommended that the player checks underfoot for dice. Second person as the primary actor: When you shoot with this weapon, not When a player shoots with this weapon. See % (percent). plugin = noun, as in a software component that extends functionality (I like the flow chart plugin). plug in = phrasal verb. Avoid phrasal verbs, and use a clearer alternative (plug your charger into your phone, not plug in your charger). Don’t use an apostrophe to pluralise an abbreviation — unless the abbreviation ends with an s. Even then, it is often better to add the appropriate plural noun (Automated SOS messages, not Automated SOS’s). See also abbreviations. For the possessive on a plural, see [apostrophes]. practice = noun (with regular practice, the rules become easy to remember). practise = verb (you can practise a variety of tactics). In brief: Use double quote marks only to quote passages of text or actual speech; use single quote marks for unusual phrases. Double quote marks in more detail Use double quote marks to quote passages of text or direct speech (Wazdagga said \"Oi, wossat over dere\"). If the quote is a full sentence, place terminal punctuation — such as a full stop — before the closing mark. Otherwise, punctuate after the closing mark. When you start a new paragraph within a quote, close the paragraph with terminal punctuation only (such as a full stop) — skip the closing double quote mark, but start the new paragraph with an opening mark. For long or engaging quotes, consider Blockquotes (external URL). Single quotes in more detail When you refer to events and unusual phrases, use only single quotes. setup = noun (Terrain setup). set up = verb (Set up the terrain). Don’t hyphenate. Use modern UK English spellings. So: immobilised, not immobilized; colour, not color. See also localisation and internationalisation. Do not use double spaces after a full stop or other punctuation — this became redundant when computers and proportional fonts replaced typewriters and monospace fonts. Use only a single space. Use steps to guide a reader through a process. Use alphanumeric sequences, not bullets. Use a lead-in or stem sentence where appropriate, but try to structure the content so that it is not necessary. Punctuate each step normally, to include a full stop at the end of each step. If you need to include a sub-sequence within a step, use indented lowercase letters. Like this. And like this. If you need to provide choices or points in which the order is unimportant, use indented bullets (unordered list). Like this. And like this. And then continue with the next step like this. See also bullets (unordered lists). Two words, hyphenated. See Titles and headings and Topic titles and topic file names (external URLs). Either is acceptable, but favour towards as it is more common in UK English. Check the spelling and capitalisation of trademarks and brands, and use them correctly. Do not use a trademark as a verb (search for it, not google it). Symbols like ™ and ® can be useful where appropriate, but don’t overdo it — on the first mention should be enough in most cases. Hyphenate when you use the term like an adjective to describe the operative noun, but not when you use it as the focus of a statement (we always use the up-to-date version; the publication is up to date). See Numbers. uniform resource indicator. There is a technical difference between URL and URI, but URL is in common use even where URI would be more accurate. Favour URL except where the distinction is important. See also hyperlinks (usage). uniform resource locator. See also hyperlinks (usage). A Latin term that we use to mean against or perhaps compared with. Commonly abbreviated to vs. However, it is usually better to avoid this term and use plain English instead. See versus. When you use the word as a modifier, use lower case and separate words (web address; web page; web application; web services). However, it is usual to write some terms as single words: website; webcam; webmaster; webcast. If you refer to the Web, capitalise as you would for any other pronoun — and by extension, capitalise concepts like Web 2.0. Note that 'the Web' is not interchangeable with 'the Internet' — the Web (formally, the World Wide Web) depends upon the Internet, but the reverse is not true. Use while to convey activities that happen in parallel. Use whilst to acknowledge opposing or contrasting viewpoints.

Done right, this practice is enormously helpful for effective management and delivery of modern publications. In essence, it means that each Asciidoc page source file in this project should comprise a self-contained 'topic' rather than a monolithic 'chapter' or other traditional book-based construct. The point is that topics are much easier to develop, review and reuse in clever ways that also feel more effective for the reader. Less maintenance, fewer errors, and better usability (especially in digital formats). This is a whole subject in itself, but for a quick overview of the general ideas see Every Page is Page One (external URL).

If you’ve heard of Markdown then know that Asciidoc is very similar, but more standardised and more powerful for documentation. Benefits of Asciidoc include: We can generate a range of formats (website first, hopefully app and PDF later) from the same source (single-source, multi-channel publishing). In combination with other software, it facilitates truly collaborative writing through a 'docs as code' approach. Flexible re-use of content, to minimise errors and inconsistencies in content that we want to repeat in identical or very similar tracts. Easy, robust cross-referencing and redirection of links when we need to change the address of a web page. Flexibility to allow people from outside the project team to use a web interface to view the source content and to suggest edits directly. All in all, Asciidoc is much easier to use than heavy-weight options like HTML or XML-based languages.

We aim to document our methods and processes not only to standardise things and ensure consistency in the output but also so that the project is open to scrutiny, open to ideas and open for anyone to contribute.","title":"Overview","component":"contributors-guide","version":"","name":"overview","url":"/contributors-guide/overview.html","titles":[{"text":"Project philosophy","hash":"_project_philosophy","id":1}]},"5":{"id":5,"text":"Once the source content is compiled into output formats we publish them at https://epicremastered.com.","title":"Publication","component":"contributors-guide","version":"","name":"publication","url":"/contributors-guide/publication.html","titles":[]},"6":{"id":6,"text":"Each major component of this project has files that we store in a repository. All of the repositories in this project are 'open source' — that is, anyone can view their contents, live on the Internet. The service we use to host the repositories is called GitHub. As well as version control, this service provides features that integrate project management closely with the source files. This makes it much easier to keep track of progress, to collaborate and to act on community feedback. GitHub is one of a number of services that are built around a version control technology called Git. Git is a powerful tool that helps collaborators to keep track as they add, remove, modify and share files — no matter where and when they each work on the project. Git registers a complete history of changes in every source file in the repository, along with a note of which user account made those changes. So, everyone can see what is going on and authors can compare versions and roll back mistakes if they need to. The repositories do not contain the outputs in their final form. We refer to the content that we store in the Git repositories (mostly Asciidoc content files, but some other files too) as the source content. We use software to compile the source cotnent into user-friendly output formats.","title":"Repositories and version control","component":"contributors-guide","version":"","name":"repositories-and-version-control","url":"/contributors-guide/repositories-and-version-control.html","titles":[{"text":"Version control with Git and GitHub","hash":"_version_control_with_git_and_github","id":1},{"text":"From source repositories to outputs","hash":"_from_source_repositories_to_outputs","id":2}]},"7":{"id":7,"text":"The style guide acts as a neutral arbiter of 'the right way' to write for this project. This helps to ensure a consistent standard and to minimise edits and rework — which is especially important for a project which will involve multiple authors who work at different times and places. With proper use, the style guide helps us to: Be consistent. We avoid inconsistencies that confuse or annoy readers. Reduce confrontation, because the authority lies with the style guide. People tend to think that their way of writing something is the best way — but we don’t all agree. The style guide acts as a neutral arbiter of style. This makes it easier for us to set aside personal preferences and biases. Raise the level of trust among contributors. It is easier to collaborate on content when everyone works to the same conventions without heated debate over trivia. And, writing to a consistent style means: Fewer edits, less rework. We produce high quality content more quickly. Faster onboarding. New contributors can quickly understand and meet expectations. Better content. We avoid ambiguity and common mistakes, so that the publication is easy to understand and free of needless distractions.

This is partly because such projects don’t scale well, given the inherent complexity and the typical tools and processes that are in use: 'More collaborators' doesn’t always equate to 'faster and better progress'. Yes, collaboration is great in principle, because you share effort and pool ideas and expertise. But in practice, collaboration also makes it even harder to keep track of work, to ensure consistency and to reach agreement. Feedback from the wider community is hard to get and to track in a way that makes it easy to discuss and act upon. Even when the writing and editing is 'done', the actual publishing usually involves many labour-intensive steps. And in spite of all the marketing buzz words, most software for writing projects doesn’t actually help much with these challenges. So, while we could work hard with word processors/wikis/forums/whatever, I’d much rather we work smart…​ So, I’ve chosen technologies that facilitate a 'docs like code' approach. [1] I think that this will help to bring vitality to the project in a way that traditional writing tools and processes just can’t. Eric Weston 1.

This means that we intend to: Make the rules easier to understand and use. Fix some gaps and problems in the rules. Update and extend the army lists. Add some new special abilities. Offer some optional rules and other extras. However, we have a principle that we intend to keep at the forefront at all times: That is, to respect and retain the distinct nature of the Epic 40,000 game system — we want to present the Epic 40,000 system of gameplay at its best, not create a derivative with substantial differences in gameplay. See below for more detail on these goals. Our intent is for Epic Remastered rules content to be clearer and more user-friendly than in Epic 40,000, while we keep the gameplay almost entirely the same. I say 'almost' because the original Epic 40,000 publications present some rules in ways that are confusing, contradictory, ambiguous, or even a bit 'broken' — and to fix this we must sometimes challenge common misinterpretations or, in rare cases, actually change the gameplay slightly. So, we rewrite the rules to make them easier to understand and use — clearer, better structured, more consistent, less ambiguous, and much easier to navigate and use on a mobile device too. Where we do create actual gameplay differences, we go out of our way to include footnotes to highlight and explain these. If you disagree at any point…​ well, of course no-one’s stopping you from playing it your way instead! (We’re also open to suggestions if you have a better way or you think we’ve overlooked something.) Intellectual property rights We must respect the intellectual property rights of Games Workshop plc. A thorough rewrite should also mean that we don’t infringe upon copyrights, as we’ve created a new artistic expression. (And of course we intend no challenge to the status of trademarks.) We mean to fix inconsistencies and gaps that exist in the original lists, and to extend the lists. We don’t want to extend the army lists just the sake of it, but rather to: Add some variety and character that was lacking in the original. Add some forces that Games Workshop didn’t invent until much later, but which now have a well-established place in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. Many enthusiasts enjoy these newer forces and wish to use them with Epic Remastered. Compatibility of old Epic 40,000 army lists with Epic Remastered If you really want to for some reason, there’s nothing to stop you from using the original Epic 40,000 army lists with the Epic Remastered rules. There are some minor differences in terminology, and where Epic 40,000 defines some army-specific rules in its army lists, we’ve rationalised and redefined these in the Special abilities section instead — but that’s about all that you’ll need to adjust to. Our philosophy for existing special abilities is much the same as with the rules of play — we’re just rationalising things. However, we’re also adding some new abilities that help us to extend the army lists and gameplay in interesting ways. To be clear, when we refer to Epic 40,000 we usually mean the entire set of publications — not only the books and other materials that were in the original Epic 40,000 boxed set that Games Workshop released in 1997, but also various updates that they published later, mainly in the Firepower magazine series and the Epic 40,000 Magazine series.","title":"About this publication","component":"core","version":"","name":"about-this-publication","url":"/core/about-this-publication.html","titles":[{"text":"Improving the rules content","hash":"_improving_the_rules_content","id":1},{"text":"Improving the army lists","hash":"_improving_the_army_lists","id":2},{"text":"Adding to the special abilities","hash":"_adding_to_the_special_abilities","id":3},{"text":"Source materials","hash":"_source_materials","id":4}]},"11":{"id":11,"text":"To make this publication as user-friendly as possible across all formats, we use 'web-first' writing techniques rather than traditional 'print-first' techniques.

Then you’ll be able to use your mobile device to consult the rules even when you have no Internet access. As for Portable Document Format (PDF): With the current state of the publishing technology we’re using, PDF output would demand far too much manual intervention for us to produce this alongside the web output. [1] And, as a traditional print-based output format, PDF has some major drawbacks that complicate publishing and updates, even at the best of times — it’s far too static for a rapidly changing project. (And it’s awkward to use on-screen too.) However, when the project reaches a suitable level of maturity and stability then we can consider a PDF output for those who really want it. We’re hopeful that by that time we’ll have the tools to publish to PDF much more easily than we can at present. 1. This project uses Antora, a static site generator for the Asciidoc plain-text markup language, and GitHub Actions to deploy updates to the website with very little effort.

Epic Remastered is by fans, for fans, and open to the community as a collaborative effort. Date of this build: 2024-01-09 This project is now well under way, but we still have lots to do. We’re not yet ready to treat any part of the project as 'stable' — we treat all content as 'draft' and subject to change at any moment. So, we don’t spend the time to document the changes (except at a high level as occasional updates in the Facebook group — see Discussion). Important features are likely to change without notice. Styling is minimal. The content components in this project are as follows: Main project Core: The main body of the project, principally the core rules of play. This component is now functionally complete, but there are still improvements we’d like to make and details to attend to. Among other things, we need to create and add graphics and images — especially where explanatory examples are concerned. Battles: Additional rules for setup and play. First drafts are in progress in this component, but there are a number of empty placeholder topics at present. Armies: Guidance on how to choose and build your armies, along with army lists that detail detachments, unit data sheets and points costs. There is almost no content in this component at present — but fear not, you’ll find army lists in the interactive Detachment Builder. Contributor’s Guide: Guidance for contributors, to help with governance and consistency, and to document our methods in a transparent way. You’ll also find links to the game content components in the main navigation menu. You can switch between all main project components at the component menu (at the bottom of the secondary navigation panel). Also important to the project, but held in different repositories and hosting: Detachment Builder Epic Remastered Detachment Builder: A convenient way to choose your army online and to print out your detachments and unit data sheets. Ian Wood continues to adapt and extend this from the open source 'Army Forge' software to suit our needs, and to populate it with new and revised content. We intend to mirror the Detachment Builder content in the Armies component eventually. You’ll also find a link in the main navigation menu at Resources Detachment Builder.

Lunr supports some special search functions that you can use to refine your search. We explain some of these here. By default, Lunr includes variations on stem words in its results. Example 1. Stem words and their variations shoot will yield not only instances of the stem word 'shoot' but also variations such as 'shoots', 'shooter' and 'shooting'. This works in combination with most other search functions. Many search tools support exact match searches, usually through the use of double quotation marks (\"ork\"). However, at the time of writing, Lunr does not support exact match search. You can use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard, anywhere in your search term. Example 2. Trailing wildcard search sho* will yield instances of words that begin with 'sho', such as 'shoot' and 'should'. Example 3. Leading wildcard search *oot will yield instances of words that end with 'oot', such as 'shoot' and 'boot'. According to the Lunr documentation leading wildcards \"…should be used sparingly. They can have a negative impact on the performance of a search, especially in large indexes.\" Example 4. Middle wildcard search s*t will yield instances of words that begin with 's' and end with 't', such as 'shoot' and 'silent'. By default, Lunr will search both the content of topics and the titles of topics. If you want to find matches only in titles, you can use the title: prefix. Example 5. Titles-only search title:shoot will yield only instances of 'shoot' that appear in topic titles — it will not yield instances that appear elsewhere in the content. You can combine titles-only search with other search functions and multiple terms. Example 6. Titles-only search with other functions and terms title:sho* fire will yield instances where a word in a topic title begins with 'sho', or where the word 'fire' appears anywhere in the content. You can of course enter multiple terms into the search box at one time. By default, Lunr will combine your terms together with the logical operator OR — and thus you’ll get results that match any or all of the terms you entered. Example 7. Term presence search — default behaviour with multiple terms ork gun will yield instances where either 'ork' or 'gun' exist, or both exist. (Effectively 'ork OR gun'.) However, you can change the behaviour for each term that you enter. You can define which terms you want to be present or absent to match results: To indicate that a term must be present, prefix the term with a plus (+) character. To indicate that a term must be absent, prefix the term with a minus (-) character. Example 8. Term presence search — 'must', 'may' and 'must not' behaviour +ork gun -trukk will yield instances that must contain 'ork', may contain 'gun' and must not contain 'trukk'. (Effectively 'ork AND/OR gun NOT trukk'.) Example 9. Term presence search — 'must' behaviour to simulate AND +ork +gun will simulate a logical operator AND search — that is, it will yield only results that contain both 'ork' and 'gun'. (Effectively 'ork AND gun'.) Fuzzy matching can be helpful where you’re not sure how to spell a word, or you want to expand your search to include more 'close' matches in your search results. To use this, append a tilde (~) and then a positive integer to a term. The positive integer defines the 'edit distance'. An edit distance of 1 will match words that differ from your search term by only one character. That is, words that would match your search term if you were to add, remove or change a single character, or to transpose a single pair of characters. Example 10. Fuzzy-match search ork~1 will yield instances of words that are within one edit of 'ork' — such as 'Mork' or 'ark'. This search would not return matches for 'stork' as that would require two edits, to add an 's' and a 't'. When you search for multiple terms, it may be that some terms are more important to you than others — that is, results where these terms have a more significant presence are likely to be more relevant to you. For such cases, you can 'boost' the relevance of particular terms. This makes Lunr treat those terms with more significance — any topic that matches a boosted term will get a higher relevance score, and appear higher up in the search results. To apply a boost to a term, append a caret (^) and then a positive integer. Example 11. Boosted search — single boosted term shoot broken^10 will score the term 'broken' 10 times higher than the term 'shoot'. So, Lunr will prioritise results that include the word 'broken' ahead of those that contain the word 'shoot'. The boost value can be any positive integer, and you can give different boosts to different terms if you like: Example 12.

If you’re an avid tabletop wargame enthusiast then you’ll have most of this already. Otherwise…​ you might have to borrow, buy or make some of these things. And, welcome to the addictive world of wargames! Play for fun, don’t sweat the losses and may all your games be jolly and entertaining! An opponent! Epic Remastered is primarily a two-player game, with no solo-play rules. Two armies of 'Epic scale' miniatures to represent the Warhammer 40,000 factions that you and your opponent wish to play. 'Epic scale' is nominally 6 mm or 1:285 scale, but varies somewhat in practice. A suitable wargames table to serve as your battlefield. The 'default' size for Epic games is 240 cm by 180 cm (~6' by 4'). Miniature terrain to make your battlefield visually appealing and tactically interesting. You don’t always need these, but they can be useful to make notes and reminders during the course of a game. You might also use a pencil and paper-based method to design and record the details of your army between games. [TODO: Add something about paper rosters/detachment cards and digital alternatives, especially the Epic Remastered Detachment Builder.] You’ll need to measure distances a lot in the game. A pair of trusty retractable measuring tapes are ideal. You’ll want ones that have centimetres (cm) marked on them. Ordinary six-sided dice. Wargamers can never have too many, but 20 or 30 is plenty. You can manage with pencil and paper, but it’s nice to have some markers that you can use to track damage (and shields) on some of the larger engines of war in the game. You might consider: Dice of a different size, colour and/or number of faces to your handfuls of ordinary dice. 'Damage tracker' or 'wound' dials — available from many manufacturers, in a range of styles. You need various visual markers, templates and other aids to track particular effects in the game. You need markers to identify the specific orders that you choose for your detachments, and for conditions that are in effect. (As we explain at Orders and conditions.) Original Order markers The original markers that Games Workshop produced for the Epic 40,000 and Battlefleet Gothic games are ideal if you can obtain enough of them (10 or 12 should be enough to play a typical game). These green six-sided Order markers have a different symbol on each face, and are also known as 'Order dice' for obvious reasons (although we do not use them like dice). You may be able to source these from the likes of the eBay website — although they can be expensive as they’ve been out of production for a long time. Alternative Order markers More likely, you’ll need to obtain or create alternatives. Some ideas: The marbled grey six-sided Order markers that exist for the 2016 Adeptus Titanicus game are just as good as the originals, as their symbols are almost identical. 3D-printable alternatives exist online, both in six-sided form or as individual tokens for each symbol. If you don’t have access to a 3D printer, there are retailers who sell the physical items. Make your own! Even cardboard squares with text on them will suffice. [TODO: We need some nice non- copyright-infringing designs for the order symbols, to use for the graphics in these rules. It’d be great to also add these to a downloadable 'print your own play aids' file.] [TODO: Add explanation.] These are simply circles of card with a diameter of 60 mm — originally with colourful artwork to represent explosions. We recommend that you have three. Most of the time you need only one, but there are some rare cases where it is helpful to have more at hand. The original Epic 40,000 boxed game included nice printed airfields, to help players to keep track of the readiness of their Flyer units. These are merely 'nice to have' and are only effective for a small number of flyers anyway. The main thing is to have a convenient way to keep track of which out-of-play Flyer units are in which state of readiness: Repair; Rearm; Ready. Depending on the nature of the battle that you intend to play in a given session, you may need some of these accessories. You’ll need this only when you use the Army Morale rules. [TODO: Add explanation.] You’ll need these only when you use the Objectives rules. The original Epic 40,000 boxed game included a set of full-colour cardboard objective markers. These had the name of the objective type on one side and a suitable corresponding graphic on the other. You could easily create something similar. Or, it’s even better if you create small scenic items to represent them — it is much more visually satisfying to battle over a miniature bunker or fuel dump than over a cardboard marker! Just be sure that it’s clear what objective type each scenic item represents. [TODO: Ideally, in due course we’ll add suitable designs to a downloadable 'print your own play aids' file.] You’ll need these only when you use the Hidden Setup rules. A set of cardboard or plastic markers will do, so long as each marker has a unique number to identify it. Eight or ten of these markers will be plenty for most games. If your numbered markers are small scenic items that represent clusters of foxholes and booby-traps, then so much the better for the visual effect! You’ll need these only when you use the Drop Pods rules. Even the original Epic 40,000 boxed game didn’t include these (although the Armies of the Imperium expansion for the second edition of Epic did). But they’re easy to make: Get some thick paper or thin card. Photo paper for inkjet printers is a good choice. Draw a 1 cm grid, 4 cm by 10 cm, to create 40 squares. Use a pen or stamp with permanent ink to number each square, from 1 to 40. Cut out your squares — hey presto, 40 Drop Pods tokens (more than you’re ever likely to need at one time). [TODO: Ideally, in due course we’ll add a suitable design to a downloadable 'print your own play aids' file.] You might consider a different material, shape and/or size for your tokens. As long as you and your opponent use the same tokens then it is fair. But keep in mind that you’ll be dropping these tokens from a height, and these characteristics affect how the tokens typically distribute. For example, round tokens will sometimes roll across the play area, away from the rest, whilst plastic tokens may bounce and knock miniatures that are in play. [TODO: It might be good to suggest optional alternative rules that don’t require tokens.

But why not hit enemy air forces when they are at their most vulnerable — while they are on the ground! Send your flyers on a ground attack against the enemy airbase! This is our version of the Counter-strike mission that appeared in the Air Superiority article which Games Workshop published in both Firepower, issue 1, and White Dwarf, issue 214.

You must declare each Flyer detachment that you wish to perform this mission at the appropriate step in the Start phase. [TODO: Presumably, we resolve Counter-strike in the Movement phase, but we should make it explicit.

[TODO: Do we need to state something to the effect that flyers that are on a mission do not enter the Repair or Rearm states until after any Counter-strikes are resolved?] Where your opponent has Flyer units in the Ready state, but not declared for a mission, these units automatically scramble to get airborne.

You must place them so that they all face in the same direction. This is where they will start their attack run. Flyers have an unlimited move, but you can only move them in the direction that they face when you place them. So, you must move all Flyer units that are in the same detachment in parallel courses, in formation. Enemy units can Snap Fire at them as they move — but in contrast to ground units, Snap Fire does not halt the movement of Flyer units. You may halt movement of Flyer units at any point — halt them all at the same time. Make ranged attacks with the Flyer units, just like you would with ground units in the Shooting phase — use the Firepower values of the Flyer units and any super-heavy weapons that they have. But note: You can draw a line of fire only where an enemy unit lies within range and inside the forward 90° arc of your Flyer unit.

This means that, for example: Your opponent may use artillery on Preparatory Bombardment orders to shoot at them in the Movement phase, before they can disengage.

This can be an effective method to deploy reserve forces at the optimum time and place. Well-known examples include Necron portals and Eldar Webway portals. The rules that govern how we use the Portal ability to transport units are very similar to those for the Transport (X) ability. However, there are some important differences. Where we include Portal on a unit data sheet — or for an objective — we also include some further information, as attributes in brackets. For example, like this: Portal (INF, 4+, Walker, Auto). Mostly, these attributes indicate what other friendly units can actually pass through the portal — that is, which kinds of unit that portal permits you to embark and/or disembark as 'cargo' units during the game. (INF): Permits Infantry units as cargo. (4+): Permits Vehicle units that have an Armour value of 4+ or lower as cargo. (Walker): Permits Vehicle units that have the Walker ability as cargo, regardless of their Armour value. We also indicate how the portal affects the arrival of detachments that you intend to use with it, through the (Roll) or (Auto) attributes. See Portal Reserves for more about this. We use (Roll) and (Auto) to represent different technologies for different factions. They are mutually exclusive, for both thematic and practical reasons — so all Portal units in a given army list are of one type, never a mix of both. Where your army includes any units or objectives that have the Portal ability: Regardless of the scenario, you may keep some detachments out of the play area, as Portal Reserves. You may do this with any number of your detachments that contain units that your Portal units permit as cargo. Don’t get carried away — if you have many Portal Reserves detachments out of play and few suitable Portal units in play then you’re in for a hard time! Where your unit or objective has the Portal ability and is in play: You can use this unit to move Portal Reserves detachments into play after they arrive. See Portal Reserves. You can use this unit to move detachments that are in play from this portal to another portal that is in play, or from another portal that is in play to this portal. See Use a Portal unit to move your forces. You can use portals to move some of your forces around. Where you wish to move one of your detachments into or out of a portal, and it contains permitted cargo units: You may do this only in the Movement phase, and only if you give the detachment Advance or Assault orders. Embark and disembark cargo units in the same way as for the Transport (X) ability. See Transportation by Transport (X) units. [2] [3] You may use each individual portal only once per turn, to embark or disembark units from a single detachment. Any portal that you use becomes unavailable until the start of the next turn. You may embark a permitted cargo unit that is already in the play area into an available portal — but you must immediately disembark the unit from a different available portal elsewhere in the play area. [4] These Portal Reserves rules are a special variation on the standard Reserves rules. The difference is in the detail of how detachments that you set aside as Portal Reserves will arrive, and how you put them into play. You can put Portal Reserves detachments into play only by means of Portal units. The type of portal that your army can include determines how detachments that you keep aside as Portal Reserves will arrive: Where your army has (Roll) portals, roll on the Reserve Detachment Arrival table for your portal reserves detachments in the Start phase — just as you do for standard Reserves. Where your army has (Auto) portals, do not roll on the Reserve Detachment Arrival table for your Portal Reserves detachments in the Start phase — instead, they always arrive in turn 2. Either way, once a Portal Reserves detachment arrives, you must put it into play if possible, in the Movement phase. This can be tricky. To put a Portal Reserves detachment into play after it arrives, you need an available portal — and some units can only use particular portals that permit their transit. If there is no portal available when you need it, then you must leave the detachment in Portal Reserves this turn — it does not arrive yet after all.* If none of the available portals can disembark all of the units in the detachment, then you may choose either: Leave the detachment in Portal Reserves this turn — it does not arrive yet after all.* Disembark as much of the detachment as you can. The units that cannot disembark count as destroyed for the purposes of army morale and victory conditions. Place a Blast marker on the detachment. *If you leave the detachment in Portal Reserves, then: If your army uses (Roll) portals, then you must roll on the Reserve Detachment Arrival table again next turn. If your army uses (Auto) portals, then you must try again next turn. If the detachment does not arrive and enter play before all Portal units/objectives in your army are destroyed or the game ends, then the detachment counts as destroyed for the purposes of army morale and victory conditions. [5] [6] To complete the move of units that you can put into play, obey the rules at Use a Portal unit to move your forces. Example 1. Necron Portals You have a Necron army which includes, among other things, two different Portal units: A Monolith WE unit — which has Portal (INF, 4+, Auto). A Warbarque WE unit — which has Portal (INF, Walker, 4+, Auto). Your army also includes two detachments that you decide to keep outside of the play area, as Portal Reserves: Detachment A, which contains some Necron Warriors (INF), Lokhust Destroyers (INF), and Tomb Blades (VEH with Armour 4+). Detachment B, which contains some Necron Immortals (INF), Canoptek Spyders (VEH with Walker), and a C’Tan Shard (VEH with Walker). As the portals in the Necron army list are (Auto) portals, detachments A and B will both arrive in turn 2. When they arrive, you can use detachments A and B with the Portal units as follows: All of the units in detachment A can pass through either portal. So, you can use either Portal unit to disembark detachment A, provided the portal is available. The Walker units in detachment B can pass through only the Warbarque’s portal. So, you must either: Use the Warbarque Portal unit to disembark this detachment, provided the portal is available. Use the Monolith Portal unit to disembark this detachment, provided the portal is available — but in this case, the Canoptek Spyders and the C’Tan Shard are destroyed and you must place a Blast marker on the Immortals units that form what’s left of the detachment.

When you disembark cargo units from an objective that has the Portal ability, you obviously cannot pay 5 cm of its movement like you would with a mobile transport unit. In this case, just deduct 5 cm from the movement of each cargo unit that you disembark, as usual, and ignore the deduction that would normally apply to the transport unit. 3. When you disembark units that you’re bringing into play from Portal Reserves, treat them as already embarked — so you only pay the 5 cm cost to disembark. 4. To be clear, there is no option to use a portal to transfer units out of the play area during the game. 5.

This is similar to how Damage Capacity works with War Engine units. That said…​ Units that have the Robust ability are not War Engine units — do not apply the War Engine rules to them. In brief, it takes two hits to destroy a Robust unit, and each Robust unit counts as two normal units for both hit allocation and detachment strength. We’re testing this ability as a way to make some units tougher than the standard rules allow, but not as tough as War Engine units. Candidates for this ability include Space Marine Land Raiders, Ork Stompas, and Chaos Greater Daemons. Where your unit has the Robust ability: The unit starts the game with Damage Capacity 2. When you calculate the detachment strength, count the unit as equal to its remaining Damage Capacity. Each hit reduces its Damage Capacity by one point. If the unit’s Damage Capacity is reduced to 0 then it is destroyed. Where you attack a detachment that includes units that have the Robust ability: Each Robust unit counts as either one or two units for hit allocation, according to the number of Damage Capacity points it has left. This means that when you allocate hit dice and you reach a Robust unit, you must allocate two dice if it is undamaged or one die if it is damaged. Then continue to allocate dice to more distant targets in the usual way. Where possible, all dice that you allocate to a Robust unit must score equal to or higher than its Armour value, or all dice that you allocate must score lower. The aim of this restriction is to force the attacker to destroy the unit or bypass it, and so to minimise the need to track units that have only one remaining point of Damage Capacity. You may not allocate a further hit die to the unit until you have first allocated hit dice to all eligible units, in the usual way. Any hit that would automatically cause critical damage against a War Engine unit, such as a hit from a Death Ray weapon, causes an extra point of damage instead against a Robust unit. In other words, a single hit from such a weapon will always destroy a Robust unit outright. A Robust unit counts as one unit for all other purposes, such as 'ganging up' and hit rolls in close combat, supporting a close combat, and to determine the number of units that are under a Barrage template. Example 1. Robust ability and detachment strength Consider a Space Marine detachment like this: Units Number of units Detachment strength 1x Captain 1 1 6x Land Raider (with the Robust ability) 6 12 5x Terminator squad 5 5 Total 12 18 Although the actual number of units is only 12, the Robust ability of the Land Raiders means that the effective detachment strength is 18. So, at the outset of the battle you will benefit from a +1 modifier for Leadership tests. The detachment will be at half strength when its number of normal units and remaining Damage Capacity totals nine or less. Example 2. Robust ability and allocation of shooting hits You shoot your detachment of Orks at a Space Marines detachment that includes Terminator (Armour 5+) and Land Raider (Armour 6+) units. Figure 1. Robust ability and allocation of shooting hits. The green rectangle is a detachment of Orks. The blue rectangles are Space Marine Terminator units. The Blue circles are Land Raider units that have the Robust ability. Your dice rolls yield six results of 5 or more — so you have six hit dice to allocate. Allocate a die to the nearest target unit, Terminator squad (1). The next nearest unit is Land Raider (1), which has the Robust ability — so allocate two dice to it. These must either both be results of 6 that can affect the Land Raider, or both be rolls of 5 that cannot affect the Land Raider. The next nearest units are Terminator squads (2) and (3), so allocate the fourth and fifth die to these. Finally, you must allocate your last die to the next nearest unit, which is Land Raider (2).

Example 1. Assault moves and charge moves with a mixed Space Marine detachment You have a Space Marine detachment that is on Assault orders. Your detachment includes Space Marine, Assault and Bike units. You proceed to move this detachment in the Assault phase. The Space Marine unit has a Speed value of 10/20 cm. You can use the second value of 20 cm where you use the extra movement to make a charge move. That is, you may move your Space Marine units up to 20 cm where you use this to put them into base contact with an enemy unit; otherwise, you may only move them up to 10 cm. The Space Marine Assault unit has a split Speed value of 20/30 cm, as a result of the Jump Packs ability. You can use the second value of 30 cm where you use the extra movement to make a charge move. That is, you may move your Assault units up to 30 cm where you use this to put them into base contact with an enemy unit; otherwise, you may only move them up to 20 cm. The Space Marine Bike unit has a Speed value of 35 cm. As a Vehicle unit, you do not get a special increase to their Speed value for a charge move. That is, you can move your Bike units up to 35 cm, regardless of whether or not you put them into base contact with enemy units. Example 2. Charge moves with an Ork detachment You move the first three Ork Boyz units into contact with the blue Marines units. Then you move Ork Boyz (4), and you want to make base contact again. You could move them towards one of the blue Marines units, as you may put up to two units into contact with an enemy unit. Instead, you choose to ignore the blue Marines units that are already in contact with friendly units, and you move Ork Boyz (4) into base contact with yellow Marines (B). You cannot move Ork Boyz (4) into base contact with yellow Marines (A). This is because you would move them away from (past) Marines (B), who are closer than Marines (A). Example 3. Charge moves with an Ork detachment, with a more distant enemy unit You move Ork Boyz (5). You could move them into base contact with one of the Space Marines units where you have already placed Orks in base contact; or you may move them towards yellow Marines A, which is the nearest enemy that is not in base contact with a friendly unit. If you wanted to move Ork Boyz (5) towards towards the more distant yellow Marines (C), then you would have to end movement of Ork Boyz (5) at the point where they reach the red line. This is because any further movement towards yellow Marines (C) would be away from (past) yellow Marines (A). Why you might want to approach a more distant enemy unit You might ask why you would want to move Ork Boyz (5) towards yellow Marines (C). This could be for several reasons, such as: It puts Ork Boyz (5) within range of an objective, or in a better position for the next turn. It increases the likelihood that, if you win the close combat, you will destroy Space Marine units as they try to retreat. That is, because you put your Orks further forward, there is less room for your opponent to place their retreating Space Marines units such that they are at least 15 cm away from your units — and so you may destroy more of them. Of course, this also works against you if you lose the close combat…​ Where yellow Marines (C) is in a separate Detachment: You hope to win the close combat against the first Space Marine detachment, and then trigger a firefight with the detachment that includes yellow Marines (C).

Moves in the Assault phase are subject to all the rules that we described for the Movement phase — except that the Snap Fire rule does not apply in the Assault phase.

This move must be as direct as possible towards an enemy unit. This does not necessarily mean the nearest enemy unit, or even one that is in a detachment that you intend to assault. You may not move your unit away from the enemy unit that it is nearest to. You may ignore the nearest enemy unit if you already have a friendly unit in base contact with it. Then focus on the next nearest enemy unit that is not in contact with a friendly unit. You do not have to move units more than 5 cm if you do not want to. You might only want to move units into range for a firefight or to grab an objective, for example. Nearest enemy unit The nearest enemy unit is the one that your unit could reach by the shortest route. However, you may detour around dangerous terrain if you wish, to avoid Dangerous terrain tests. In that case, the nearest enemy unit is the one that your unit could reach by the shortest route that does not include dangerous terrain.

[TODO: Can a detachment still Snap Fire while Broken?] You may make a Retreat move in the Movement phase, if you wish. This is the only type of move you may make with a Broken detachment. If the enemy engages your Broken detachment in close combat or a firefight then you must halve your detachment’s Assault and Firepower totals in the engagement. The Retreat move is a single move in which you may move all mobile units in the Broken detachment up to 20 cm — regardless of their actual Speed values. You may use the Retreat move to move the units in any direction, subject to the normal rules for terrain effects on movement. You may 'move' units 0 cm if you wish. Or, it may be that you can’t move some units anyway. [1] If you end a Retreat move such that any Broken units are within 15 cm of any enemy unit [2] , then they are destroyed — remove those units as casualties. (They are killed by the advancing enemy or scattered in the confusion — they play no further part in the battle.) If a Broken detachment has units that are out of command (that is, more than 30 cm away from their detachment HQ unit) then those units are not affected — they are not Broken and the out of command rules still apply to them. If units that are out of command become Broken, remove them as casualties immediately. There are no other effects on the parent detachment. Similarly, if units in a Broken detachment become out of command, remove them as casualties immediately. You may be able to rally Broken detachments in the End phase.

These characteristics are detailed in the unit’s data sheet. You will find data sheets for every unit in the game at Armies. Example 1. Data sheets Most units have a very simple data sheet that looks something like these: Unit Type Speed Range Firepower Assault Armour Notes Ork Boyz INF 10/20 cm 30 cm 1 2 4+ Space Marines INF 10/20 cm 30 cm 1 3 5+ Rapid Fire, Stubborn Space Marine Rhino VEH 30 cm - 0 0 5+ Transport (2) War Engine units have bigger and more complex data sheets, as we explain at War engine data sheets. Unit The unique name that specifies the kind of unit. Type The unit type of the unit (see Units and unit types). Some rules affect some unit types and not others. Speed The distance that you can move the unit in a single movement action (in centimetres). It represents a rate at which the unit can move across the battlefield and still be effective when it shoot its weapons. You can give units orders that allow you to move units farther than this, but their shooting will suffer. Some unit data sheets show a split Speed value such as 20/30 cm. Use the first value for all purposes, except where the rules tell you otherwise. For information about the second value, see Assault moves and charges. [1] Range The maximum effective distance of the unit’s weaponry (in centimetres). Firepower A value (usually a number) that represents the unit’s effectiveness when it shoots. A higher number is better. Some units are armed with super-heavy weapons that make special forms of attack. These units will usually have a word (such as Barrage or Macro-weapon) in place of their Firepower value. Assault This number shows how effective the unit is at close combat. We use this in the procedure to resolve an assault where units in one detachment charge an enemy detachment and the models are in base-to-base contact. In assaults the Space Marines' genetically enhanced bodies and superior training give them an advantage over Orks, so they have a higher Assault value. Armour This number shows how well protected and/or difficult to damage the unit is. Basically, you must roll this number or higher on a D6 to score a hit on the unit when you shoot at it. Both Space Marines and Orks are tough but the Space Marines' power armour makes them even tougher, so they have a higher Armour value. Notes If any special rules apply to the unit then we note this here. You’ll find explanations of the effects of these rules at Special rules. As you can see, the rules for Rapid Fire and Stubborn apply to Space Marines, whereas no special rules apply to Ork Boyz. 1.

Even so, most units in Epic Remastered are organised into groups with other units, to fight as a unified whole on the battlefield. We call these groups detachments. Some units, such as the Warlord Titan, do act alone and not as part of a group. Such units still comprise a detachment. Detachments represent forces that are detached from a larger organisation, such as from a company within a Space Marine chapter, or from an Ork clan within a Waaargh! (as Ork armies are known). Every detachment is led by a headquarters (HQ) unit which coordinates the actions of the detachment with others on the battlefield.

The HQ unit must always be the most 'senior unit' that is present in the detachment, as indicated in the chain of command. If the original HQ unit is eliminated then the next most senior unit in the chain of command must take over. If several units are of equal seniority then you may choose which unit to use as the HQ from that point onward. Use a suitable marker or other device to keep track, so that both you and your opponent know which unit is the HQ unit at all times. As long as a unit is within 30 cm of its detachment HQ at the start of a phase then it is in command. If a unit is more than 30 cm away from its detachment HQ at the start of a phase — or if none of the units that remain in the detachment match a kind specified in the chain of command — then such units are out of command. We explain the phases at The turn sequence. For the moment, suffice to say that most movement happens in the Movement phase, most shooting happens in the Shooting phase, and so on. In command units can move and/or shoot in that phase, according to the orders you give to the detachment. Example 1. In command You have an Ork Mob detachment in your army. At the start of the Movement phase, all of the units in this detachment are within 30 cm of their HQ, so they are in command and you may move them all. Out of command units can not move or shoot in that phase, regardless of the orders you place for the detachment. You can still complete some actions with these units, such as: Snap Fire; fight or lend support in close combat; shoot in a firefight. (We explain these actions elsewhere in the rules, in the appropriate sections.) Check to see whether units are in command or not at the start of each phase, as the situation can change through your own mistakes or through casualties. Example 2. Out of command When you check at the start of the Shooting phase, you realise that you got a bit carried away earlier — two of your Ork Boyz units are now more than 30 cm away from their HQ, and so they are out of command. Though you may move and shoot as normal with the rest of the detachment, you may not do so with these two units until they are in command at the start of a future phase. In practice this means that you may not shoot with these units in the current Shooting phase. And, unless something unusual happens [1] , then you may not move these two units in the following Assault phase either. Aside from carelessness or certain unusual circumstances, you won’t often have units that are out of command. But when you do: Don’t place Blast markers on out of command units. [2] If your current HQ unit is destroyed, you may not nominate an out of command unit as the new HQ — even if the rest of the detachment is destroyed! 1.

Shooting phase You may shoot with the units in this detachment. Assault phase You may not move the units in this detachment.

This means that the detachment is in disarray — units are in a state of confusion or even panic, seeking cover and unable to accept and respond to orders. Be careful! Broken detachments are especially vulnerable to encirclement and enemy attacks.

Should the enemy lose the rest of their entire move for the phase, or only the rest of that one move?] Roll a D6 to resolve the attack: If you score equal to or higher than the enemy unit’s Armour value then it takes a hit. We explain the effect of hits at The Shooting phase. Note these conditions: You may Snap Fire with an individual unit any number of times in a single turn — but no more than once at a particular target. As long as the target unit survives then Snap Fire does not affect its ability to act later in the turn — it can act as is usual for the orders under which it is operating. In the event that an enemy unit is already within 10 cm at the start of its move in the Movement phase, then you may Snap Fire at it only if it moves closer. You may not Snap Fire at it if it remains where it is or it moves farther away. [TODO: In effect, as Snap Fire halts movement anyway, your opponent cannot move the unit closer in the Movement phase unless either you are daft enough not to take the opportunity to apply the Snap Fire rule, or they are daft enough to needlessly grant you that opportunity!] [TODO: Can we ditch the Snap Fire rule for most purposes, and replace it with a rule like the 'zone of control' in Epic Armageddon? After all, the general effect of Snap Fire is that players don’t move units to within 10 cm anyway. Of course, we would still need Snap Fire in some form where flyers and Flak are concerned.] 1. Snap Fire represents various forms of attack that come into effect at such short range, such as booby traps or ambush. The main point is that you should position your units to make the best use of the Snap Fire rule, such that you limit enemy movement.

You must consider the risks and opportunities that the terrain presents to both your own forces and those of your opponent, at all times. Terrain affects the movement of ground units in one of three main ways: No effect: The unit can move through the terrain as normal. Impassable: The unit cannot move through the terrain at all, under any circumstances. Dangerous: The unit can attempt to enter the terrain but it might get stuck, or even suffer damage. When you wish to move a unit through dangerous terrain you must take a Dangerous terrain test for that unit. The effects often differ between unit types. Table 1. Terrain effects on movement Terrain Infantry Vehicle War Engine Fortifications No effect Impassable Impassable Buildings No effect Impassable Impassable Ruins; rubble No effect Dangerous Dangerous Woods; jungle No effect Dangerous Dangerous Marsh; swamp Dangerous Dangerous Dangerous River Dangerous Impassable Dangerous Roads See Movement on roads Open ground No effect No effect No effect When you wish to move a unit into dangerous terrain, or when you wish to move a unit that is already in dangerous terrain, roll a D6: On a result of 1: You may not move the unit any farther — leave it at the edge of the dangerous terrain. Or, where the unit is already in dangerous terrain, you may not move it. Then roll a D6 again: If you roll another 1 then the unit takes a hit. On any other result: You may move the unit as normal. We explain the effect of hits at The Shooting phase. Hits from dangerous terrain do not cause critical damage on War Engine units. Where you will move a unit such that its entire move will take place on a road — in any phase — add 5 cm to its Speed value for that move. If the unit has a split Speed value, add 5 cm to its first Speed value and 10 cm to its second Speed value. Example 1. Movement on roads An Ork Boyz Infantry unit is on March orders. Ork Boyz have a Speed value of 10/20 cm. The player will make the first two moves entirely on roads, and the third move will include some open ground. So, the player could move the unit up to a maximum of 40 cm. That is, up to 30 cm for the first two moves that are on roads ((10 cm first Speed value + 5 cm road bonus) x2), plus up to 10 cm for the third move that is not entirely on roads. Example 2. Assault moves on roads You have an Ork Boyz Infantry unit that is on Assault orders. Ork Boyz have a Speed value of 10/20 cm. You intend to make an entirely road-based assault move. So, you can make either: A normal assault move of between 5 and 15 cm (10 cm first Speed value + 5 cm road bonus). A charge move of up to 30 cm to reach base contact with an enemy unit that is also on the road (20 cm second Speed value + 10 cm road bonus).

So, it is best to discuss terrain pieces and principles with your opponent before you start the battle, to make sure that you agree on how to interpret line of sight. [TODO: Expand on this some more? Perhaps add some detail here about 'model’s eye view', hull-down, and such. Might need to rationalise with the main rules for the Shooting phase too.] Infantry that are 'in cover' — that is, in terrain that provides ready concealment and/or physical protection from incoming munitions — gain special benefits. This is because they can take advantage of cover in ways that vehicles and war engines just can’t — they can hide among trees and shrubs, crouch behind low walls and dive into dips and holes at a moment’s notice.

[1] These abilities indicate units that can carry — transport — other units across the battlefield. These abilities have some features in common, but also differ in some important ways. To refer to the actions that we take with units that we transport, we use the terms embark and disembark. To refer to the units that we transport, we sometimes use the term cargo. To be clear, a transportation unit does not gain the abilities of any embarked units. To transport one or more valid cargo units: After you embark your cargo units, you can keep them embarked until you are ready to disembark them in some later phase. Or, you may embark and disembark units in the same phase or even in the same move — so long as all of the involved units have enough movement. While a cargo unit is embarked, you may perform no other actions with it — you cannot shoot with it, for example. You may only embark each cargo unit onto a Transport (X) unit once per phase. You may only disembark each cargo unit from a Transport (X) unit once per phase. To embark one or more valid cargo units: You may embark a cargo unit only when it is completely within 5 cm of the Transport (X) unit. You must pay 5 cm from the movement of the Transport (X) unit. You must pay 5 cm from the movement of each cargo unit. To disembark one or more cargo units: You must pay 5 cm from the movement of the Transport (X) unit. [2] You must pay 5 cm from the movement of each cargo unit that you wish to disembark. [2] Place each cargo unit that you disembark such that it is completely within 5 cm of the Transport (X) unit. Where a cargo unit or the Transport (X) unit has remaining movement, you may continue to move it. To transport one or more valid cargo units: You must embark and disembark each cargo unit in the same move — or in the same series of moves, if the Hitch (X) unit is on March orders. Embark each cargo unit at any point during your move of the Hitch (X) unit, and disembark at another point in same move, or series of moves. You may only embark each cargo unit onto a Hitch (X) unit once per phase — you may not hitch a lift multiple times with the same cargo unit in the same phase. To embark one or more valid cargo units: You may embark a cargo unit only when it is completely within 5 cm of the Hitch (X) unit. You do not need to pay any of the movement of the Hitch (X) unit. You must pay all of the movement of each cargo unit. To disembark one or more cargo units: You do not need to pay any of the movement of the Hitch (X) unit. Place each cargo unit that you disembark completely within 5 cm of the Hitch (X) unit. This ends the movement for the cargo unit. Where the Hitch (X) unit has remaining movement, you may continue to move it. If a transportation unit is destroyed then any cargo unit that is embarked at the time may also suffer a hit. Before you remove the destroyed transport unit, roll a D6 for each embarked unit: On a result of 1, 2 or 3, it suffers a hit. If the unit survives, place it completely within 5 cm of the destroyed transportation unit. [3] Then remove the transportation unit as normal. Where transportation units from one detachment carry units from another detachment, both detachments must be on the same orders. [4] Related information Transport (X) Hitch (X) 1.

To minimise these problems, we’ve integrated the Transport (X) and Hitch (X) abilities with some new conditions. 2. In practice, these conditions mean that you can simply measure the movement of the cargo unit from the Transport (X) unit. But you must be able to pay the 5 cm costs first. 3. Difference from Epic 40,000: We make it clear that embarked units are subject to the same risk when their transportation unit is destroyed, regardless of which transportation ability is in effect. 4.

Vehicles probe and break through enemy lines, or prevent enemy attempts to do the same. Aircraft fight for dominance of the sky and bomb enemy positions. Infantry rush from cover to cover and fight desperate hand-to-hand combats to secure positions that other forces can’t reach or can’t hold. All these forces must work together to secure victory for their side. The playing pieces that we use to play Epic Remastered represent the many and varied forces that are at war on battlefields of the 41st millennium. In game terms, each individual playing piece represents a single independent element of these forces, known as a unit. Each unit is also of a particular named kind, such as Ork Boyz or Land Raider. Each kind has a unique set of characteristics that define its capabilities on the battlefield, which we explain at Data sheets and characteristics. Units vary widely in their specific characteristics and capabilities, but for rules purposes we classify each unit by unit type: Infantry (INF) Vehicle (VEH) War Engine (WE) Flyer (FLY) See below for more detail about each of these unit types. [1] This unit type includes the most obvious infantry, plus the likes of crew-served field artillery and some heroic characters. It also includes some creatures and small machines that operate in a similar way as far as we’re concerned with the rules. Examples include the Space Marines unit, Ork Boyz, Eldar Support Weapon Platform, Tyranid Hormagaunts, and many more. Physical representation of Infantry units We typically represent Infantry units as follows: 'Normal' infantry: Commonly five infantry models affixed to a single base. That said, some enthusiasts vary this with a greater or lesser number, where the models represent particularly weak or powerful individuals. Field artillery: One or two artillery piece models affixed to a single base — usually along with some infantry models to represent the crew. Wargamers often refer to such a playing piece as a 'base' or 'stand' of infantry. The most common formats of the actual bases are: 20 mm square 40 mm by 12 mm oblong strip 25 mm diameter circle But, just about any shape and size is acceptable, as long as they are: no smaller than 20 mm wide by 10 mm deep no larger than 40 mm wide by 40 mm deep This unit type includes the most obvious vehicles, plus some large beasts and mounted infantry (which can’t take advantage of terrain in quite the same way as smaller beasts and normal infantry). Examples include: Tanks, such as the Imperial Guard Leman Russ. Armoured personnel carriers, such as the Space Marine Rhino. Walking machines, such as the Eldar War Walker and various Dreadnought units. Some large, powerful beasts, such as the Ork Squiggoth and the Tyranid Carnifex. Mounted infantry, such as the Ork Boarboyz and the Eldar Jetbikes. Physical representation of Vehicle units We typically represent Vehicle units as follows: Tank or armoured personnel carrier: A single vehicle model. Some players like to affix their vehicle models to bases, but this is not necessary and makes little difference in game terms. Do as you prefer. Walking machine or large, powerful beast: A single walker or beast model, usually affixed to a base for stability. Mounted infantry: Two or three mounted infantry models affixed to a single base. This unit type includes very large and tough machines of war, plus some exceptionally powerful and resilient creatures. Examples include the super-heavy tanks and Titans of various factions, Gargants (which are the Ork equivalent of Titans) and some giant bio-constructs such as the Tyranid Dominatrix. These units dwarf the units of other unit types and can absorb a lot more damage before they are destroyed. Best of all, many of these behemoths have multiple huge weapon systems that can rain destruction upon your enemies! Physical representation of War Engine units We represent each War Engine unit with a single model. Some players like to affix their war engine models to bases, but this is not necessary and makes little difference in game terms. That said, where a war engine model has legs, it is usual to affix it to a base — both for stability and for clarity of measurements and other interactions during the game. Aircraft, and even some creatures that can fly within a planet’s atmosphere. These are very fast in comparison to ground-based units, and their presence over the field of battle is fleeting. Examples include the Ork Fighta-Bommer, Space Marine Thunderhawk Gunship and Tyranid Harridan. Note that 'skimmer' units such as the Space Marine Land Speeder and Eldar Falcon grav-tank are not aircraft, and do not count as Flyer units. Rather, these units have some unique capabilities that we represent with the Skimmer special ability. Otherwise, they behave just like other 'ground units' of the same unit type. Physical representation of Flyer units We usually represent each Flyer unit with a single model on a 'flying stand' — that is, the model sits on top of a vertical rod that is affixed to a base, to raise the model above the height of other units on the tabletop. 1. Our notes on physical representation are guidance, not a set of absolute rules requirements. As long as your miniatures look the part so that it is clear what they represent, and as long as you don’t abuse the flexibility for competitive advantage, then you won’t go far wrong.","title":"Units and unit types","component":"core","version":"","name":"units-and-unit-types","url":"/core/main-rules/units-and-unit-types.html","titles":[{"text":"Units","hash":"_units","id":1},{"text":"Unit types","hash":"unit-types","id":2},{"text":"Infantry (INF)","hash":"_infantry_inf","id":3},{"text":"Vehicle (VEH)","hash":"_vehicle_veh","id":4},{"text":"War Engine (WE)","hash":"_war_engine_we","id":5},{"text":"Flyer (FLY)","hash":"_flyer_fly","id":6}]},"100":{"id":100,"text":"Epic Remastered uses ordinary six-sided dice. When you roll a die, the value it gives you is the result. This is a 'natural' or 'unmodified' value. It is also your initial score — but the score may be subject to further adjustment before it is final (see Modifiers). Roll a D6 or 1D6 means roll a single six-sided die and use the result as the score. Roll 2D6 means roll two six-sided dice and add the results together to get the score. Roll 3D6 means roll three six-sided dice and add the results together to get the score. [and so on] Roll a D3 simply means roll a single six-sided die and then halve the D6 result (rounding up) to get the D3 result for your score. In other words, count a D6 result of 1–2 as a score of 1, a result of 3–4 as a score of 2, and a result of 5–6 as a score of 3. Rounding of fractions Unless the rules say otherwise, round fractions up. Roll three D6s means roll three six-sided dice all at the same time, and then check each of their results to get three separate scores. Each individual die is a single D6 roll. Re-rolls Sometimes the rules allow you to re-roll dice when you fail a test or you don’t like the result of your first roll. Unless the rules specifically say otherwise, re-rolls only apply to single rolls, and you must re-roll all of the dice in that single roll, or none of them. You may not re-roll more than once (you can’t re-roll a re-roll) and you must accept the result of the second roll. Sometimes the rules specify that you must add or subtract values from the result that you roll on the dice, to get the final score. For example, D6+6 means roll one six-sided die and add 6 to the result. Thus your final score will be in the range of 7 to 12. 1+ means you need a score of 1 or more, after modifiers. If there are no negative modifiers then you will automatically succeed without having to roll a die, unless the rules say otherwise (for example, shooting always misses on a D6 result of 1 (sometimes called a 'natural roll' or 'unmodified roll' of 1). 2+ means you need a score of 2 or more, after modifiers.

You can use Flyer units that have the Transport (X) ability to carry valid cargo units from other detachments in your army. Keep the cargo units outside the play area along with the transport Flyer units until you are ready to deploy them. If your available Transport (X) flyer units don’t have enough transport capacity to carry all of the units in your ground detachment in one trip, then choose which units to leave behind for the current mission. You can bring them into play on a future turn. Be sure to include the detachment HQ in the first wave unless you want all of your units to be out of command! Similarly, disembark later arrivals within 30 cm of whichever unit is currently the HQ unit, unless you want them to be out of command. You must declare each Flyer detachment that you wish to perform this mission at the appropriate step in the Start phase. When play passes to you in the Movement phase, place all of the Ready units in the detachment at any point along any edge of the playing area. You must place them so that they all face in the same direction. This is where they will start their attack run. Flyers have an unlimited move, but you can only move them in the direction that they face when you place them. So, you must move all Flyer units that are in the same detachment in parallel courses, in formation. Enemy units can Snap Fire at them as they move — but in contrast to ground units, Snap Fire does not halt the movement of Flyer units. You may halt movement of Flyer units at any point — halt them all at the same time. If a Transport (X) Flyer unit is destroyed while airborne then any embarked cargo units are destroyed along with it — there is no possibility that they can escape destruction in this case! Make ranged attacks with the Flyer units, just like you would with ground units in the Shooting phase — use the Firepower values of the Flyer units and any super-heavy weapons that they have. But note: You can draw a line of fire only where an enemy unit lies within range and inside the forward 90° arc of your Flyer unit. Ignore any intervening terrain though, as it is far below the altitude of the flyers. Otherwise, the attack works just like a normal shooting attack — so for example,as long as you meet the other requirements then you may split fire between multiple target detachments. Halve the Firepower of each Transport (X) Flyer unit that will disembark cargo units (and roll to lock on with any super-heavy weapons). After you resolve the shooting effects, disembark the cargo units just like you would with a ground transportation unit. But note: In each case, measure from the centre of the transport flyer’s flight stand. [TODO: Are there any awkward edge cases where this 'measure from the centre' restriction poses a problem? If yes, what is the best alternative given the variety of base and model sizes that is even more variable than with ground units?] Give the disembarked detachment whatever orders you prefer, except that you may not choose Overwatch or March orders. To be clear, you may put the detachment on Assault orders and make assault moves in the usual way this turn. [TODO: When exactly should we complete the move with the disembarked detachment? Presumably we should complete the move as part of the mission, either now or immediately after we remove the flyers in the next step?] After you complete the disembarkation, the transport flyers take off and disengage.

Much artillery is designed to rain explosive shells, rockets or missiles on the target. Some use another technology entirely, such as the deadly monofilament webs of the Eldar Web Spinner, or the living bombs of the Tyranid Biovore. Regardless, all artillery units share some common traits which we represent with the Artillery special ability. An Artillery unit can shoot over terrain that blocks its view of the target. So, you only need your Artillery unit to be within range when you choose your target — they do not need a line of fire. Artillery units can bombard enemy forces to forestall an attack or to 'soften up' an enemy position. We represent such attacks with special orders called Preparatory Bombardment. If you wish to place any detachments on Preparatory Bombardment orders, you must do this in the Start phase. [1] Place the Special orders marker to indicate that the detachment is on Preparatory Bombardment orders. You cannot move the Artillery units for the rest of the turn. [TODO: Though presumably you can move them in a withdrawal move if the detachment becomes Broken?] You can move other units in the detachment up to 5 cm. You can make your preparatory bombardment attack either: Immediately before your opponent starts their part of the Movement phase. Immediately after your opponent ends their part of the Movement phase. Use the normal Shooting rules to make the bombardment with the Artillery units in the detachment. You can’t shoot with the other units in the detachment yet, but once you’ve completed the bombardment, you may put the detachment on Overwatch orders if you wish.

The more closely packed the units of the target detachment, the more effective Barrage weapons are likely to be against it. This is simply because the barrage will have more target units within its area of effect. When you make a Barrage shot: Place a Barrage template in the standard way, but with these additional considerations: Place only a single template, no matter how many Barrage units in your detachment contribute to the attack. Place the template so that it is completely within range and line of fire of all of the Barrage units that contribute to the attack. You may opt to exclude some Barrage units from the attack, but you may not make any separate attack with them against the same target detachment. Cover as many units in the target detachment as possible. Count the number of units of the target detachment that are under the template. This number is the Firepower value that each Barrage unit contributes to the total Firepower that your detachment directs at the target detachment. When you place Blast markers, Barrage weapons contribute to your detachment’s total Firepower, but not to the number of super-heavy weapons. It still takes only a single Blast marker to suppress a Barrage weapon though, just like any other super-heavy weapon. Barrage and intermingled detachments under the template After you place the template to cover as many units in the target detachment as possible, it may be that the template also covers some units from another detachment. Make a separate count of the number of units of the other detachment that are under the template. After you have resolved the attack against the target detachment, use the separate count to resolve the attack against the other detachment, as if it were a separate attack. Example 1. A classic Barrage unit The Space Marine Whirlwind armoured vehicle is armed with a Whirlwind missile launcher. What this vehicle lacks in range it can make up for in speed and the ability to rain a destructive barrage of missiles down onto an area of the battlefield. Example 2. Adding up Barrage Firepower You shoot with three Space Marine Whirlwind units at an Ork Warband detachment. This target detachment is partially intermingled with a Kult of Speed detachment. Figure 1. Adding up Barrage Firepower. Numbered rectangles are Ork Boyz units; solid circles are Gunwagon units; semi-opaque circles are Barrage templates. Green units are in the Ork Warband detachment; red units are in the Kult of Speed detachment. You place one Barrage template for all three Whirlwinds. In total, the template covers three units from the target detachment: The template covers Ork Boyz (1) and (2), and the Gunwagon. Ork Boyz (3) is not covered by the template because their centre is not under the template. Ork Boyz (4) is in a different detachment, the Kult of Speed — so we make a separate count to resolve the attack against that detachment. So, against the target detachment, each Whirlwind adds 3 Firepower to the total for your detachment’s attack. As the Whirlwinds have no other help, the total is 9 Firepower against the Ork Warband detachment. After you resolve that, you also resolve the attack against the Kult of Speed detachment. Each Whirlwind contributes 1 Firepower in this case, for a total of 3 Firepower.

For optimum effectiveness, Flak units and their detachment need to be at a suitable state of readiness. We represent this state with special orders called Flak. Declare the Flak orders If you wish to place any detachments on Flak orders then you must do this in the Start phase. [1] You can place a detachment on both Flak orders and Preparatory Bombardment orders at the same time in the Start phase, if you wish. You must declare both at the same time. In this case, you will be able to make a Preparatory Bombardment with Artillery units in the detachment, and make Flak attacks with Flak units. Place the Special orders marker to indicate that the detachment is on Flak orders. You can use these units to shoot at flyers in the movement phase. You may not move the units in the Movement phase, nor use them to shoot in the Shooting phase. Treat the other units in the detachment as though they are on Overwatch orders — so you can move them up to 5 cm in the Movement phase and re-roll misses when you shoot with them in the Shooting phase. Make Flak attacks You can use a Flak unit to shoot at enemy Flyer units in the Movement phase if any part of their flight path is within the Flak unit’s full range: Do not use the Firepower table. Roll one D6 for each point of the Flak unit’s Firepower value. Each result that is equal to or higher than the Flyer unit’s Armour value scores a hit. (See Hits on flyers) You can split the firepower of the Flak unit between several target Flyer units if you wish. Or, where your Flak unit has a super-heavy weapon, you can apply the effects as normal. Once you have rolled a D6 for each point of the Flak unit’s Firepower, or you’ve used its super-heavy weapon, you cannot shoot again with this unit for the rest of the turn. [TODO: This wording implies the player could split Flak unit firepower between multiple waves of flyers in the phase. Is this intended and important? If not, then it’d be simpler to phrase and to track in-game if we say that once you’ve made a Flak attack with a unit you can’t shoot with it again that turn.] Example 1. Flak, with a super-heavy weapon The Eldar Fire Prism has a single Macro-weapon attack. This means that you will roll one die, and you’ll hit on a result of 4+ — regardless of the flyer’s Armour value. Apply these rules to the unit’s Snap Fire attacks against flyers in the Movement phase: Use the Flak unit’s full range, instead of the usual 10cm. Resolve hits as at Hits on flyers. You may not use super-heavy weapon effects — such as Macro-weapon — for Snap Fire attacks. Example 2. Flak attacks [TODO: New example text and image needed] Related information Flak Drop Pods 1.

Nimble fighter aircraft, sturdy fighter-bombers, lumbering bombers, cargo transport aircraft — all have their place in support of ground forces in the 41st millennium. In many ways, Flyer units and detachments are quite different to ground forces, and their rules reflect this. Flyers have data sheets just like regular units — but with these differences: The Speed value is always Flyer. Flyer units are so fast that we treat them as though their Speed value is unlimited — you can move them as far as you wish across the play area. The Assault value is a split value, such as 2/2. We call this the 'Dogfight value' — although most of the time we refer specifically to only one of its two parts: The first number is the Intercept value of the flyer, which represents its overall manoeuvrability. The second number is its Gunnery value, which represents the overall deadliness of the flyer’s air-to-air weaponry, when it can get an enemy flyer in its sights. You don’t deploy flyers along with other units at the start of the battle — place them somewhere outside of the playing area, in the Ready state (see Flyer readiness states). You can imagine that they are in orbit, or stationed at a nearby airbase. Do not place Blast markers on Flyer detachments, at all.

So, you must move all Flyer units that are in the same detachment in parallel courses, in formation. Enemy units can Snap Fire at them as they move — but in contrast to ground units, Snap Fire does not halt the movement of Flyer units. You may halt movement of Flyer units at any point — halt them all at the same time. Make ranged attacks with the Flyer units, just like you would with ground units in the Shooting phase — use the Firepower values of the Flyer units and any super-heavy weapons that they have. But note: You can draw a line of fire only where an enemy unit lies within range and inside the forward 90° arc of your Flyer unit.

The Firepower table includes target categories especially for War Engines and for Immobilised War Engines. These categories reflect the fact that these units are so large and easy to hit. A War Engine unit can become Immobilised — and so even easier to hit — as a result of critical damage. There is no target category for 'Immobilised War Engine in the open' — instead, you simply roll as many hit dice as the total Firepower that you direct at the unit. If a target detachment contains both mobile and Immobilised War Engine units, then you may choose to shoot at only those that are Immobilised, if you wish. If you do this then you may allocate hits to the Immobilised units only. Unlike other units, War Engine units can absorb more than one hit before they are destroyed. Each War Engine unit has an initial Damage Capacity value on its data sheet, which shows how many hits it can take before it is destroyed. Each unsaved hit reduces the current Damage Capacity of the War Engine unit by one point. The unit is destroyed only when its current Damage Capacity value reaches zero. How to keep track of damage To keep track of remaining Damage Capacity on each damaged War Engine unit you might simply keep notes on a piece of paper. Or, you may like to use coloured dice or 'damage tracker' dials — when a War Engine takes damage, place a die or dial near it at the correct value to show the remaining Damage Capacity for that unit.

This is usually a moment of high drama and excitement — will your carefully positioned behemoths live up to their fearsome reputations and lay waste to the enemy? War engines make excellent mobile weapons platforms — but their sheer mass means that they can’t point their weapons in any direction at a moment’s notice. The rules here add some extra detail to reflect these features. Each War Engine unit has one or more weapon mounts. [1] These are simply the weapon-carrying locations on the war engine, and have names like Left Carapace or Right Arm. Each weapon mount also has: A weapon system that defines the weapon effects that exist in this mount (Weapon systems). A weapon arc that restricts the line of fire of the weapon system (Weapon arcs). We list each weapon mount that a War Engine has in a separate line on the unit’s data sheet, along with the corresponding weapon system details and weapon arc. Each weapon system provides one of these weapon combinations: [1] One or more shots from a ranged super-heavy weapon. Multiple shots from such a weapon system are just like multiples of that super-heavy weapon, except that we treat the weapon system like a single super-heavy weapon for various game effects. A close combat super-heavy weapon, such as Close Combat Weapons or Ripper Tentacles. In some cases the weapon system may combine this with a basic Firepower value. A basic Firepower value. This represents some kind of battery of heavy weapons. Where you can choose from a wide range of weapon systems, we leave empty boxes on the data sheet for you to fill with the information to match your particular choices. While you may split fire to target different detachments with different weapon systems, you may not split fire with the effects of a single weapon system. For critical damage results, apply effects that destroy or restrict a weapon to the whole weapon system. [TODO: If we reference 'weapon system' rather than 'weapon' on every data sheet in future, perhaps we can do away with this bullet point?] Where a weapon system does not have a basic Firepower value, treat it like a single super-heavy weapon: When your detachment’s Firepower is halved for any reason, roll to lock on with each of its super-heavy weapon systems — not with each individual shot. Super-heavy weapon systems may contribute to the placement of Blast markers in one of two main ways, depending on whether or not they contribute Firepower in the attack. After Firepower, each remaining Blast marker suppresses one entire super-heavy weapon system. In a firefight, a super-heavy weapon system contributes 1 Firepower — regardless of the number of shots. Each weapon mount on a War Engine unit has a weapon arc. [2] The arc constrains the line of fire for the weapon system in that mount. You may only use weapons in that weapon system to target detachments that are inside within that arc, and you may only allocate hits to units that are inside of that arc. We use icons on the War Engine data sheets to show what arc applies to each weapon mount. Figure 1. Anatomy of a weapon arc icon The arrow in the centre of each icon represents the facing of the war engine. The black segment indicates the weapon arc, relative to the facing. Figure 2.

Half Firepower and 'lock on' Where a game effect forces you to halve the Firepower of a detachment or unit, you also suffer a reduction in the effectiveness of its super-heavy weapons. [1] In these situations, you must test to lock on with each super-heavy weapon before you can shoot with it. Lock on For each super-heavy weapon that you wish to shoot, roll a D6. On a roll of 4+ the weapon locks on successfully, so you may shoot with it. Otherwise, you may not shoot with it this time. Overwatch Where a unit that is equipped with super-heavy weapons is on Overwatch orders you may re-roll misses when you shoot with these weapons, just as you do with dice that you get from Firepower. When you shoot with a detachment that includes super-heavy weapons, you may get to place two lots of Blast markers: For any regular Firepower that your detachment brings to bear on the target detachment, place Blast markers as normal.

Do not modify this number because of Assault orders, Blast markers on the shooting detachment, or anything similar. Do not count super-heavy weapons that add to the detachment’s Firepower total, such as Barrage — the Firepower component already accounts for any Blast markers that they may add. Normally, suppression means that for each Blast marker on a detachment you must reduce its Firepower total by 1. However, if the detachment has more Blast markers than Firepower, or has no Firepower, then for each remaining Blast marker you lose the ability to shoot with one super-heavy weapon. You may choose which super-heavy weapons are suppressed. The entire super-heavy weapon is suppressed, even if it has multiple shots like Pulsar (X), or adds to a detachment’s Firepower like Barrage. Where a super-heavy weapon is in a position to contribute to a firefight, it contributes 1 Firepower. Example 1.

You may make more turns, at a cost of 5 cm of the unit’s move per extra turn of up to 45°. Example 1.

You want to manoeuvre your Gargant towards the Space Marines, around the woods. It has a Speed value of 15 cm. You move it as follows: Forward 5 cm, then a free 45° turn. Forward 5 cm, and then another 45° turn which costs the last 5 cm of the Gargant’s movement. Now the Gargant is in the perfect position to blast the Space Marines with its ranged weapons! [TODO: Should we mention Snap Fire here, to be absolutely clear?

Make the move in the same way as for forward movement, except that you may not move the unit more than 5 cm. In the Assault phase, you may choose not to move units in a War Engine detachment — but then you may not initiate close combats or firefights with them either.

The technologies reflect different approaches but achieve a similar defensive effect. Power fields are many but irreplaceable during a battle, while void shields are fewer but repairable. Where a War Engine is equipped with power field or void shield technology, its data sheet will tell you this — along with how many fields or shields it has at the start of the battle.

But, if you have some and you enjoy the spectacle, it can be fun to use them — and if your opponent agrees, you could allow infantry to use them as cover. There are two main ways that we determine when you may use the Drop Pods rules — either by the scenario that you intend to play, or by the composition of detachments in your army. Some scenarios state conditions under which you may use the Drop Pods rules for some detachments. Example 1. Scenarios that let you use the Drop Pods rules The Battle 6: Planetary Assault scenario lets the attacker use Drop Pods to bring some of their first wave of troops into play. Some army lists let you build specific detachments that can use the Drop Pods rules in any scenario that does not explicitly forbid them. You can do this where: The notes for the detachment state that you may use the Drop Pods rules — so long as you also meet any extra restrictions that these notes specify. You build a detachment that contains only units that have the Deep Strike ability, or that are embarked in units that have both the Transport (X) and Deep Strike abilities. You build a detachment that contains only units that have the Tunneller ability, or that are embarked in units that have both the Transport (X) and Tunneller abilities. Unless a scenario says otherwise, you don’t have to use the Drop Pods rules with such detachments — you can still deploy them in the usual way, if you prefer. Example 2. Detachments that let you use the Drop Pods rules In the Imperial army list: The Space Marine detachment specifies criteria that allow you to build detachments with which you can use the Drop Pods rules. The Imperial Tunneller Company detachment offers units that have both the Transport (X) and Tunneller abilities. This means that you may use the Drop Pods rules with this detachment — and, if you have another detachment that is comprised solely of suitable 'cargo' units, you may have the tunnellers carry that detachment into battle too. In the Craftworld Eldar army list: The Eldar Warhost detachment includes Swooping Hawk Aspect Warriors, among the choices you can make. For any Eldar Warhost detachment you build that includes only Swooping Hawk Aspect Warriors units, their Deep Strike ability lets you use the Drop Pods rules with that detachment. When you intend to use the Drop Pods rules in a game, act as follows. For convenience, we refer to any valid detachment that you intend to use with the Drop Pods rules as a 'Drop Pods detachment'. Place all Drop Pods detachments in Reserves. Drop Pods detachments must always start the game in Reserves. No matter what units they contain, all Drop Pods detachments have a Reserve Speed of 30 cm.

After a given Drop Pods detachment arrives, you must put it into play in the following Movement Phase. When you are ready to put it into play, proceed as follows: Decide what orders to give to the detachment: You may choose only Assault orders or Advance orders. Gather your Drop Pods tokens — you need one token for each unit in the detachment. Use pen and paper to record which individual unit corresponds to each specific numbered token. Place all of the tokens on a Barrage template. Hold the template 30 cm (12 inches) directly above the target point marker that you placed earlier. Invert the template sharply, so that the tokens fall and distribute themselves across the surface of the play area below. Hopefully they’ll all land in a random spread that is fairly close to the target point marker. Remove the target point marker — you no longer need it. Identify all units that correspond to tokens that landed outside of the play area or in terrain that is Impassable to Vehicle units. These units are destroyed. Your opponent may resolve Snap Fire against all tokens that are within 10 cm of any of their units. If your opponent has Flak units that are on Flak special orders then they may resolve shots as if the tokens are Flyer units (use the Armour value of the unit that corresponds to the token). Remove tokens that suffer a hit and identify the corresponding units — these units are destroyed. For each token that remains in the play area, replace it with its corresponding unit. You may now move the units of this detachment in the usual way, as appropriate to the orders you chose for them. Place the appropriate Order marker, if you haven’t already.

Hastily dug trenches and emplacements, foxholes, formidable reinforced bunkers, and the like, give troops effective cover. Razorwire is a simple but effective menace to infantry, and even to vehicles. Well-placed razorwire can slow down enemy forces at a critical point, or funnel them into a crossfire. Forces in fortified positions are harder to destroy with shooting, and more difficult to reach with assaults too. Where a scenario tells you that you may use fortifications, use them as follows. Place these fortifications before the start of the game, in your deployment zone, at the same time as you deploy your detachments. Note that you may deploy only Infantry units within these fortifications, as fortifications are Impassable to Vehicle and War Engine units. To the extent that you have suitable scenic items, you may set up any amount of these fortifications. Keep in mind that the more of these fortifications you put into play, the greater the risk that your opponent will use them against when they overrun part of your position! [TODO: Shouldn’t War Engine units be able to cross trenches…​? Perhaps it’d be good to expand these rules a bit to differentiate between hasty entrenchments and the likes of hardened bunkers and redoubts…​? And perhaps to allow Vehicle units to use emplacements? Also, it’d be good to disambiguate the term 'Fortifications' so it is clearer when we mean all fortifications including razorwire, and when me mean specific cover-giving fortifications as in this section and in the terrain tables.] These fortifications offer excellent cover to Infantry units, and are Impassable to Vehicle and War Engine units. See Terrain effects. Place razorwire before the start of the game, after you have deployed your detachments. To the extent that you have suitable scenic items to represent razorwire, you may set up any amount you like. You may place each section of razorwire anywhere that is within 15 cm of either: The units you deployed. Hidden Setup markers that you placed instead of units. No player may move Vehicle or Infantry units over razorwire while those units are subject to March or Assault orders — unless those units have either the Skimmer or Jump Packs ability.

Where a scenario tells you that you that the Defender uses the Hidden Setup rules, act as follows. Gather your Hidden Setup markers. You need one for each detachment of Infantry and/or Vehicle units in your army — regardless of whether or not any of these detachments will be in Reserves or otherwise not deployed at the start of the game. You do not need markers for War Engine units — they’re simply too big to hide! Use pen and paper to record which numbered Hidden Setup marker corresponds to each specific Infantry and/or Vehicle detachment. During deployment for the scenario, place your Hidden Setup markers instead of the detachments they represent. You may place a given marker within terrain, as long the corresponding detachment includes at least one unit that can move into that terrain. (See Terrain effects on movement.) You can shoot your detachments at the Defender’s Hidden Setup markers. Although your forces can’t see where the enemy units are, they can shoot at likely locations in the hope that they achieve a useful amount of suppression. Each time you shoot with one of your detachments at a Hidden Setup marker, resolve the shooting much as if the Hidden Setup marker were a detachment, but with these differences: [TODO: How, exactly do we resolve shooting at these markers? For example, if the marker is in cover, do we use the 'Vehicle or Infantry in cover' column on the Firepower table, and apply the Infantry Armour bonus for cover?] The target detachment that corresponds to the marker does not suffer any casualties from hits. Calculate Blast markers as normal, but place these next to the Hidden Setup marker — they might affect the Defender later. For the purposes of Army Morale totals, ignore Blast markers that are on Hidden Setup markers. You cannot move or shoot with a hidden detachment until you reveal it. You may reveal any hidden detachment at any time during the game turn — even if this interrupts your opponent’s movement actions. When you reveal a detachment, proceed to deploy it as at Deploy a revealed detachment (Defender). As soon as an enemy ground unit moves within 15 cm of a Hidden Setup marker, you must reveal the nature of that marker and act as follows: [1] If the marker corresponds to a detachment that is in Reserves, or that you may not deploy yet for any other reason, then this marker is a 'dummy' — it represents an area that might contain mere decoys, or that may also contain booby-traps or a minefield! Do not place any units, and instead go to Dummy markers, booby-traps and minefields. Otherwise, proceed to Deploy a revealed detachment (Defender). Choose one of your units from the corresponding detachment and put it in the place of the Hidden Setup marker. Then place all the rest of the units from that detachment within 15 cm of this unit — but not within 15 cm of any enemy unit. Transfer any Blast markers that the Hidden Setup marker has to the detachment, and then remove the Hidden Setup marker. Decide what orders you want for the detachment, and place an Order marker as appropriate. Apply the effects of Blast markers as normal; for example, if you want to place Overwatch orders then you must first pass a Leadership test. [TODO: Resolve inconsistency: The original text here is inconsistent with the usual rules, because it implies that all 'special' orders require a Leadership test just to set them, like Overwatch does: \"When a hidden detachment is revealed the owning player may place it on special orders if he wants to (eg, Overwatch or Assault), but if there are any Blast markers on the detachment it must pass a Leadership test first.\"] When the approach of an enemy unit forces you to reveal a dummy Hidden Setup marker, roll a D6: [2] 1 to 3: The marker represents decoys only — discard it with no further effect (along with any Blast markers it has). 4 to 6: The marker represents not only decoys but also an area of either booby-traps or a minefield; as the controlling player, you may choose which it is. Roll a D6: On a result of 2+, the enemy unit that forced the reveal of the dummy marker takes a hit. Then discard the marker (along with any Blast markers it has). If you have a suitable scenic item then you may replace the dummy marker with a minefield in the same position. Minefield items can be up to 15 cm long by 5 cm wide. Any time an enemy unit enters a minefield, make an attack with a Firepower value of 1 — that is, always roll one die to hit. This minefield attack affects the target unit directly — it bypasses any void shields and power fields that might otherwise protect the target unit. A given minefield can attack any number of different units in a turn, but can only attack the same unit once in a turn. Units that start a turn within a given minefield suffer an attack from that minefield only if they move. Skimmer and Jump Packs units do suffer the effects of minefields, but Flyer units do not. [3] Related information Hidden Setup markers 1. Flyer units cannot reveal hidden detachments. 2. Only dummy markers that are revealed by enemy movement can be booby-traps or a minefield. If for any reason you voluntarily reveal a marker that does not correlate to a detachment that you will deploy immediately, then that dummy marker automatically has no further effect. 3. Difference from Epic 40,000: The original rules are ambiguous on this point, but we think it makes sense that a unit that crosses multiple different minefields in a single phase will be subject to multiple attacks. So, we phrased the text in a way that makes this clear.","title":"Hidden Setup","component":"battles","version":"","name":"hidden-setup","url":"/battles/scenario-special-rules/hidden-setup.html","titles":[{"text":"Setup (Defender)","hash":"_setup_defender","id":1},{"text":"Play","hash":"_play","id":2},{"text":"Shooting at Hidden Setup markers (Attacker)","hash":"_shooting_at_hidden_setup_markers_attacker","id":3},{"text":"Revealing hidden detachments (Defender)","hash":"_revealing_hidden_detachments_defender","id":4},{"text":"Deploy a revealed detachment (Defender)","hash":"deploy-a-revealed-detachment","id":5},{"text":"Dummy markers, booby-traps and minefields","hash":"dummy-markers","id":6},{"text":"Booby-traps","hash":"_booby_traps","id":7},{"text":"Minefields","hash":"_minefields","id":8}]},"223":{"id":223,"text":"Some scenarios specify that you must set up markers to represent battlefield objectives that the opposing forces seek to attain or to deny to their enemy. Such scenarios explain what objective markers to place. They may also include special instructions that add to or over-ride the default rules that we explain here. There are various types of objective, and each type has specific restrictions on where you can place corresponding markers. However, you must also observe these general restrictions by default: You may not place any objective marker within 15 cm of any of your other objective markers. You may not place any objective marker within 15 cm of the edge of the playing area — unless the scenario specifies that your forces enter from that edge. (In effect, that table edge is the leading edge of your deployment zone.) We recommend that you base all objective-related measurements on the centres of the markers rather than on their edges. This gives you a bit more room to place them and means that it doesn’t really matter exactly how big or small each marker is. For the most part, you can only benefit from your own objectives. Except where the rules say otherwise, you gain nothing from control of your opponent’s objectives. Of course, it is in your interests to prevent your opponent from getting the benefits of their objectives. The standard objective types and their default rules are as follows. [TODO: We should tweak the 'R4. Check the game end conditions' topic and the 'End of turn' part of the turn sequence, and rationalise how we refer to objectives and Morale effects that we check or apply 'in the Rally phase' or 'at the end of the turn'. At present, the arrangement incorrectly implies that some Morale effects happen after we check for the game end conditions in the turn sequence.] This objective represents a location on the battlefield that is vital or highly advantageous to hold for as long as possible in the face of the enemy. Placement: You must place the objective marker either in your opponent’s deployment zone or more than 90 cm away from your deployment zone. Game effects and control: At the end of the Rally phase: If you have a unit that is within 15 cm of your Take & Hold objective marker and closer to it than any enemy units, then you are in control of this objective this turn. Morale effect: At the end of each Rally phase: For each Take & Hold objective that you control, add D3 points to your Army Morale total. This objective represents something that is significant to both sides in the conflict — something that both sides wish to control, to the exclusion of the other. Vital plans perhaps, or an important hostage. Placement: You must place the objective marker more than 90 cm away from your deployment zone and within a terrain feature that offers an Infantry Armour bonus for cover. Game effects and control: When a player moves a ground unit that they control onto the objective marker, they may use that unit to 'pick up' the objective. We call this the 'escort unit'. The player can then continue to use the escort unit entirely as normal for its type — it’s just that the objective travels with it. If the escort unit is destroyed, leave the objective marker at that point on the playing surface — leave the marker there until either player moves a unit they control over it, picks it up, and becomes the current escort unit. If the escort unit is destroyed in close combat then, if there is a surviving enemy unit that was in base contact with the escort unit, the opposing player may declare this unit as the new escort unit and pick up the objective immediately. To be clear, only you can make the initial pick up of your Rescue objective. However, once you have done this, it is possible for your opponent to destroy your escort unit and then have one of their units pick up your unescorted Rescue objective and become the current escort unit, as we explain above. Morale effect: At the end of each Rally phase: For each of your units that has a Rescue objective (that is, for each of your units that currently count as an escort unit), apply both of these effects: Add 1 point to your Army Morale total. Your opponent must deduct 1 point from their Army Morale total. This objective represents something of particular value to the enemy that you want to destroy to hinder them in some way — a site of strategic or tactical value such as a command bunker, communications relay or missile silo. Placement: You must place this objective marker inside your opponent’s deployment zone. Game effects and control: The bunker objective marker represents a static unit that has these characteristics: Table 1. Bunker data sheet Unit Type Speed Range Firepower Assault Armour Notes Bunker WE 0 cm 0 cm 0 2 6+ Damage Capacity 3 Your goal with this objective is to use shooting and/or assaults to attack and destroy the bunker. Treat the marker as if it were an enemy War Engine unit that is in the Immobilised condition. If it suffers critical damage, it is destroyed, irrespective of any remaining Damage Capacity. In an assault, enemy units that are within 15 cm of the bunker objective marker can lend support during the Assault phase. [TODO: Clarify. My guess is that the intent is for such units to lend support, but not for this alone to cause their detachment to count as engaged in the assault…​ but I’m not sure.] Morale effect: When you destroy your bunker objective, roll a D6 — your opponent must immediately deduct the score from their Army Morale total. Then remove the objective marker from the playing area. This objective represents something of particular one-time value to your forces — such as a fuel dump or an ammunition store. When your forces capture it they exploit it immediately and continue with the battle. Placement: You must place this objective in your opponent’s deployment zone. Game effects and control: At the end of the Rally phase: If you have a unit in base contact with your Capture objective marker, then you control this objective. Morale effect: At the end of the Rally phase: For each of your Capture objectives that you control at the end of a turn, choose and apply one of these effects: Capture: Add D6 points to your Army Morale total. Destroy: Your opponent must subtract D6 points from their Army Morale total. Then remove the objective marker from the playing area. This objective represents an area that you want to keep out of the enemy’s hands. Placement: You must place this objective marker inside your own deployment zone. Game effects and control: At the end of the Rally phase: If you have a unit that is within 15 cm of your Cleanse objective marker and closer to it than any enemy units, then you control the objective.

Rather, they hold some elements in reserve, at some distance from the battlefront. This gives them the flexibility to adapt as the battle progresses, to reinforce areas that are weak or to capitalise on a breakthrough. Or sometimes, elements of the available forces may be ready to join a vanguard when it encounters the enemy. Some special rules or scenarios state that you may or must place some of your detachments in Reserves. This means that you will not deploy these detachments before the start of the game. Instead, you will put them into play when they arrive at some point after the start of the game, as we explain below. For convenience, we refer to a detachment that is currently subject to the Reserves rules as a 'Reserves detachment'. During the scenario setup, leave all Reserves detachments out of play. That is, do not deploy them before the game, but instead keep them close at hand to bring into play later. Unless the rules say otherwise, Reserves detachments arrive and go into play as we explain here. We determine the arrival of each Reserves detachment as a function of the Reserve Speed of the detachment, the number of turns you’ve already played, and the roll of a die. A detachment’s Reserve Speed is equal to the Speed value of the slowest unit in the detachment, ignoring units that are embarked in transport units. [1] In the Start phase of each turn, use the Reserves Detachment Arrival table to determine whether or not each Reserves detachment arrives: Roll a D6 for each of your Reserves detachments — the table shows the score you need to trigger the arrival of a given Reserves detachment. Table 1. Reserves detachment arrival table Detachment’s Reserve Speed Turn #1 #2 #3 #4 #5 #6 Up to 30 cm - 4+ 4+ 3+ 3+ 2+ Over 30 cm - 3+ 3+ 2+ 2+ 2+ Flyer - 3+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ By default, no Reserves detachment can arrive in the first turn. After that, while you have Reserves detachments that have not entered play, at least one must arrive and enter play each turn. If you roll for all of your detachments and fail to get any die result that would trigger the arrival of a detachment, then your Reserves detachment with the highest Reserve Speed will arrive. If you have multiple detachments that tie for the highest Reserve Speed, then select one of these at random. When your Reserves detachments arrive, they enter play anywhere along the table edge that lies inside your deployment zone. Place the detachment’s HQ unit on this table edge. This shows the point at which units from that detachment will enter play. If you want multiple arrived Reserves detachments to enter play at the same point — along a road, perhaps — simply place their HQ units in a column at that point. In the Movement phase, measure movement for all units from the point on the table edge that the HQ unit identifies — not from the HQ unit itself! 1. To be clear, where you have a detachment that is transporting another detachment, treat them as a single detachment for the sake of arrival — and ignore the cargo units when you determine the Reserve Speed.","title":"Reserves","component":"battles","version":"","name":"reserves","url":"/battles/scenario-special-rules/reserves.html","titles":[{"text":"Setup","hash":"_setup","id":1},{"text":"Play","hash":"_play","id":2},{"text":"Arrival of Reserves detachments","hash":"_arrival_of_reserves_detachments","id":3},{"text":"Putting arrived Reserves detachments into play","hash":"_putting_arrived_reserves_detachments_into_play","id":4}]},"225":{"id":225,"text":"These rules cover unusual situations that apply in some scenarios and not in others.
